### MOE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME (FAS)

<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) is to help needy Singaporean students to meet their basic schooling expenses. The FAS could be funded by MOE or the school.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Detailed information about the household income requirements and benefits can be found on the MOE website: <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance" target="_blank">MOE financial assistance scheme</a> (https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance)</p>

### SCHOOL-BASED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME (FAS)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students who are not eligible for MOE FAS but require assistance, may approach the school General Office for further information and assistance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Completed forms with supporting documents can be submitted through the school to be processed. Applicants will then be informed by the school of the outcome.</p>
