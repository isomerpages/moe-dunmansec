# Choir

### Introduction

The choir is directed by the conductor Mr Toh Ban Sheng and supported by a committed team of teachers. Our Choir made history as the first neighbourhood school choir to clinch Gold in the demanding Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Choral Competition in 1997. Since then, the Choir continues to attain Gold at SYF in 1999, 2003, and 2005, the prestigious Gold (with Honours) award in 2007, 2009 and 2011 at the SYF and the Distinction award at the 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations (SYF AP). Together with other school choirs, despite the challenges of the worldwide COVID-19 situation, we also participated in SYF AP 2021, where our choir members got to experience recording our choice piece for the first time.
