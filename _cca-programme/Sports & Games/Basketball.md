### Introduction

![](/images/Student%20Development%20Programme/CCA%20Programme/Sports%20&%20Games/basketball.jpeg)

For the past decade, the Dunman Secondary Basketball CCA has established itself to be a major contender for the zonal and national competitions every year. In 2009, our first batch of ‘B’ division girls, against all odds, cliched our first ever National title. Since then, our teams have achieved an astonishing 23 National titles (8 National champions, 6 National runners – up, 4 2nd runners – up and 5 3rd runners – up).

The rise of Dunman Basketball from its humble beginnings coincides with the upgrading of our sports facilities during PRIME in 2007. During the period of upgrading, our teams trained at outdoor neighbourhood basketball courts or the basketball courts in community centres. This went on for a full 18 months until our ISH was completed, that we were able to train indoors for the first time. This period tested the resilience of the entire team.

Currently we have a total strength of almost 80 students within four divisions. With a five teachers in-charge and two well established coaches, students of Dunman Basketball are nurtured to unleashed their talents, learn the importance of camaraderie, and work to become an all rounded student athlete.

Our students come from various ethnic groups (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian and Filipino) and there is strong cohesion and respect among the members within the teams. The close bonds and respect for one another were formed through the training sessions and competitions. In addition, players also learn the importance of good sportsmanship, discipline, and fair play.

The consistent performances from the various groups from Dunman Basketball have established itself as a force to be reckoned with in the nationwide schools basketball scene! We will continue to strive hard for zonal and national competitions in the future.

### Trainings

The Dunman basketball teams trained hard and took part in numerous friendly matches and tournaments such as the Schools’ East Zone and National competition, Milo Cup, T-Net competition etc. in a bid to give the players exposure at the highest possible level.

Apart from the trainings, time slots were also allocated for the DSA players to focus on homework and revision to ensure that they remain on task in terms of their studies.
