Our CCA’s goal is to develop disciplined and daring athletes, imbued with a strong sense of duty to the team. They play their competitions with a tenacious determination for winning and clear discernment in fair play and sportsmanship. They will be gracious in victory and undaunted in defeat.

### Achievements 

Both the B & C Division Boys took part in the East Zone Inter-school Badminton Championships. They are frequent contestants in the second rounds of the zonal games. They also participated in external competitions such as the Wee Kim Wee Badminton Tournament. One of our teams had advanced to the quarter-finals of this fiercely contested tournament, in which over 30 teams from the top schools in Singapore had entered.
