<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been playing netball since primary school and I have never felt the thrill of winning the national championship. When I joined the CCA in sec one, I was privileged to be able to make it into the school team even though I was new to the CCA. We miraculously made it to the top 2 national schools even after placing 4th in east zone and after a tight game we managed to clinched the first place in 2017. At that time I was really proud of the team as we fought till the very last whistle without giving up. Knowing that everyone gave their all really made me very proud. ~ Inarah Hazirah, 4C 2020  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For almost 3 years of experience I had in Dunman, I have to say that there are countless proud memories I have. One of the most memorable one was the achievement of the team being able to achieve 2nd in the East Zone competition and 4th in nationals in 2018 as we went through a lot of tough times, going through thick and thin as a team. Although we did not achieve our goal to become champions in the East, we fought hard in the national round to become 4th in national which I felt was something to be proud of. ~ Bernice Goh, 3F 2020</p>

### Trainings

The Dunman Netball Team usually train 3 times a week.   
Tuesday: 3 pm to 6 pm   
Thursday: 3 pm to 6 pm   
Friday: 2:30 pm to 5:30 pm

<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides training to prepare ourselves for competitions, we learnt many values and lessons that are applicable to our lives and for the future. Netball is not only a sport but can also bring people together despite our differences. Dunman has given me many opportunities to play with people from other schools and even other countries. These opportunities to play, observe, learn from others are rare and I appreciate it very much. While the trainings can be intense, I have also learnt to manage my time to balance academic work, cca and family. After every training, I feel a sense of achievement that I have improved and grown not only as a netballer but also as a person.  ~ Kathy Mok, 3G </p>
