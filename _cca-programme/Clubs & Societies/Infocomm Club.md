### Introduction

The Dunman Infocomm Club strives to enrich the IT skills of its members through a progression of trainings, courses and competitions. The club focuses on two areas to develop the IT skills of its members, namely Robotics (programming with physical) and Coding (programming).

The club has a dedicated Robotics Room which houses our lower secondary members. Members are introduced to basic-intermediate Robotics with block-based programming which allows them to experience both the physical building of LEGO Mindstorm EV3 Robotics systems as well as the mentally challenging Robotics programming to overcome obstacles and perform specific tasks.
