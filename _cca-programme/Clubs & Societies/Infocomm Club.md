The club has a dedicated Robotics Room which houses our lower secondary members. Members are introduced to basic-intermediate Robotics with block-based programming which allows them to experience both the physical building of LEGO Mindstorm EV3 Robotics systems as well as the mentally challenging Robotics programming to overcome obstacles and perform specific tasks.

Upper secondary members are trained in Mobile Application Development using Thunkable on iMacs or iPads to learn the process of creating digital media, developing critical thinking and analytic skills as they seek to understand the power of the game development engine.
