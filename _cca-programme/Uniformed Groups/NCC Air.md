### Introduction
 
Established in 1999, Dunman NCC Air aims to instill in our cadets pride, honor and mutual respect.  We aim to do our best in all our endeavors, be it in competitions or involving our cadets in enriching activities.  

### Achievements

In 2020, we received our 18th consecutive Distinction Award for our performance in 2019 in the Unit Recognition (UR) award. We thank our cadets for their dedication and perseverance in training, and the parents and teachers of our cadets for their continuous support in spite of the exceptional circumstances this year.

### Trainings

NCC Air offers a variety of activities, such as hands-on training at the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) fighter and helicopter simulator centres, military plane joyrides, SAR-21 shooting, aeromodelling courses, Outward Bound Courses and airbase visits. In addition, there are also camps such as Camp Forge, Camp Steel and Senior Specialist Leaders’ Camp. The list goes on. 

Our cadets also get the opportunities to enhance their knowledge on Total Defence through various activities such as facilitating the Total Defence Strategy Card Game to other Secondary 2 students during Total Defence Day.


We look forward to the future, and we will continue to seek new avenues to enrich the NCC Air experience of our cadets and to identify and encourage the next budding pilot in our midst.
