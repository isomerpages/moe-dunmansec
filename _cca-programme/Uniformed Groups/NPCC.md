In 2019, the unit participated in the NPCC Inter-Unit Drills Competition. During the 2019 Year-End holidays, selected Secondary 2 to 4 cadets were also preparing for the biennial NPCC Inter-Unit Campcraft Competition to be held in February 2020. 

Besides participating in competitions, our cadets contributed to publications for the biannual Police Youth Ambassador (PYA) magazine. The unit submitted four articles which were all featured in the December 2020 issue.

Our cadets also participated in ad-hoc competitions organised by NPCC HQ, such as the NPCC Cadet Learning Video Competition 2021. A group of Secondary 3 cadets produced a short video on the harmful effects of drug use and emerged as the top 3 schools amongst 19 submissions.

### Trainings
  
In Semester 1 of 2021, the Corps took hold of the opportunity to conduct face-to-face trainings and completed many key milestones for the Secondary 1, 2 and 3 cadets. The Secondary 1 cadets participated in their first area event where the Dunman NPCC unit hosted the Police Procedure Course for Area 8.
