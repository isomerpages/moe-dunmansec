In 2019, the unit participated in the NPCC Inter-Unit Drills Competition. During the 2019 Year-End holidays, selected Secondary 2 to 4 cadets were also preparing for the biennial NPCC Inter-Unit Campcraft Competition to be held in February 2020. 

Besides participating in competitions, our cadets contributed to publications for the biannual Police Youth Ambassador (PYA) magazine. The unit submitted four articles which were all featured in the December 2020 issue.

Our cadets also participated in ad-hoc competitions organised by NPCC HQ, such as the NPCC Cadet Learning Video Competition 2021. A group of Secondary 3 cadets produced a short video on the harmful effects of drug use and emerged as the top 3 schools amongst 19 submissions.

### Trainings
  
In Semester 1 of 2021, the Corps took hold of the opportunity to conduct face-to-face trainings and completed many key milestones for the Secondary 1, 2 and 3 cadets. The Secondary 1 cadets participated in their first area event where the Dunman NPCC unit hosted the Police Procedure Course for Area 8.

The Secondary 2 cadets went through their Crime Science Investigation course where they learnt and experienced how crime scene investigators handle a crime scene.

The Secondary 3 cadets participated in their Secondary 3 Classification Shoot where the cadets got the experience to handle the .22 Revolver. 

The Secondary 3 cadet leaders assumed leadership of the unit after the annual Passing Out Parade in April and had to shoulder the responsibility of taking charge of the junior cadets within a short span of time. The Teacher Officers, Honorary Officers and Cadet Inspectors worked closely with the Secondary 3 cadets to ensure that the training standards were not compromised, whether the trainings were physical sessions with Safe Management Measures or e-CCA sessions via video conferencing. 

For example, the Secondary 3 cadets completed their PYA project by reaching out to their family members in order to comply with the prevailing Safe Management Measures. 

With the limited physical sessions in Semester 2, the Corps also had to engage in a blended mode of assessment for the annual promotion test. The Secondary 2 cadets, built a tent model as part of their assessment this year which replaced their usual tent pitching assessment in the field.

Despite the challenges at the start of their leadership journey, the Secondary 3 cadet leaders have become more confident and are putting in their best efforts to engage the junior cadets. The Secondary 1 and 2 cadets look forward to CCA sessions as well, with high attendance rates for both physical and e-CCA sessions.
