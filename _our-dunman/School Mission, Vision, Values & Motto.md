### The Dunmanite Creed
Together you and I will leave  
As distinctive Dunmanites,  
Discerning in our choice of right from what is not,  
Disciplined in attitude and conduct;  
Daring to experiment and forge breakthroughs and;  
Determined in all that we do;  
As it is our Duty  
To serve and better our school, community and nation.

### Philosophy
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every child has different abilities, can become an enquiring and independent learner, and can learn to accept responsibility for his learning outcome.</p>
