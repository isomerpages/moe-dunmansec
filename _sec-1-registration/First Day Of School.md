<h4>First Day of School</h4>
<p>Secondary One First Day of School &amp; Orientation Experience (2 – 10

A series of activities, including team-building games, have been planned
to help prepare your child/ward to settle into the Dunman family. In addition,
please refer to <strong><em>Annex A </em></strong>for the detailed breakdown

<h4>General School Rules</h4>
<p>Students are required to put on the full school uniform with the school
tie every Monday. They may wear the school’s formal Polo T-Shirt, with
school pants/skirts on other days if they wish to do so. Please note that
as the prescribed school uniform is an important part of school identity,
modifications to the uniform are not allowed. Students are also required
to wear their name tag (students will collect from the bookshop at a later
date) and white school shoes at all times.</p>
<h4>Co–Curriculum Activity (CCA) Performing Arts Audition &amp; Sports Trial</h4>
<p>There will be CCA Auditions held in the afternoon of 6 and 7 January 2025
for Secondary 1 students. Please be reminded to bring along a pair of PE
attire, as reflected in the packing list. Attendance is compulsory. There
will be a CCA audition briefing on 3 January 2025. This is to ensure that
all students will be familiar of the procedures during their CCA auditions.
Further details will be provided to students during the administrative
briefing on 2 January 2025.</p>
