#### Secondary One First Day of School & Orientation Experience (3 - 6 January 2023)

The orientation experience, organised by the student leaders under the guidance of their teachers, promises to be both meaningful and exciting. A series of activities, including team-building games, have been planned to help prepare your child/ward settle into the Dunman family. In addition, please refer to **_**Annex A**_** for the detailed breakdown of activities during our Secondary 1 Orientation Experience from 3 January to 6 January 2023.

#### General School Rules

Students are required to put on the full school uniform with the school tie every Monday. They may wear the school’s formal Polo T-Shirt, with school pants/ skirts on other days if they wish to do so. Please note that as the prescribed school uniform is an important part of school identity, modifications to the uniform are not allowed. Students are also required to wear their name tag (will be issued to students on a later date) and white school shoes at all times.

#### Co–Curriculum Activity (CCA) Auditions

There will be CCA Auditions held from 2.00 pm to 5.30 pm on 5 and 6 January 2022. Do note that on 5 January 2022, the CCA auditions will be held for all Secondary 1 girls and on 6 January 2022, the CCA auditions will be held for all Secondary 1 boys. There will be a CCA audition briefing during the first day of school. This is to ensure that all students will be familiar of the procedures during their CCA auditions. Further details will be provided to students during the briefing on 4 January 2022.
