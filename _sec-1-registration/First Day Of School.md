#### General School Rules

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are required to put on the full school uniform with the school tie every Monday. They may wear the school’s formal Polo T-Shirt, with school pants/skirts on other days if they wish to do so. Please note that as the prescribed school uniform is an important part of school identity, modifications to the uniform are not allowed. Students are also required to wear their name tag (students will collect from the bookshop at a later date) and white school shoes at all times.</p>


#### Co-Curriculum Activity (CCA) Performing Arts Audition & Sports Trial

<p style="text-align: justify;">There will be CCA Auditions held pm on 3 and 4 January 2023 for Secondary 1 students. Please be reminded to bring along a pair of PE attire, as reflected in the packing list. Attendance is compulsory. There will be a CCA audition briefing during the first day of school. This is to ensure that all students will be familiar of the procedures during their CCA auditions. Further details will be provided to students during the administrative briefing on 3 January 2023.</p>
