# Student Management / Attire Questions

**1. Are the students allowed to bring handphones to school?**

In Dunman Secondary School we do allow students to bring their mobile phones to school along with specific rules and regulations pertaining of mobile phone usage in the school. 

There will be a discipline briefing for the students come during the first week of school and this briefing will include details on the rules with regards to mobile phone usage in our school. 

While there are various consequences when students misuse their mobile phones in school, we focus on discipline with care and we believe that discipline is an educative process where it is more than just getting students to go through the consequences with greater emphasis on ensuring they learn and reflect on their actions so that they will not commit the same offence again.

**2. What time is the reporting time for school?**

Students will report at 7:25am at the school parade square.

# Student Academic Development Questions

**1. What is the criteria for my child to take Pure Sciences and Combined Sciences in Secondary 3?**

We will provide students with Education & Career guidance throughout their years in Dunman to help them understand their strengths, interest and passion. At the end of Secondary 2, students will be placed in their preferred subject combination based on their strengths, learning aptitude and subject availability. Students taking Pure Sciences usually show strong academic abilities and passion in their Science and Maths. More details will be shared during Secondary 2 Streaming Talk for parents.

**2. Are there end-of-year examinations for my child?**

There are end-of-year examinations for all students in the school, including Secondary 1 students.

**3. How often is homework given to my child?**

Homework serves as a way for students to consolidate their learning and one of the platforms for us to give feedback. At the same time, we will ensure students are not overloaded with homework and the amount given is moderated.

**4. What if my child’s third language lessons clash with their CCA training sessions?**

Third language lessons are held at external language centres once or twice a week. As these centres have their own lesson schedules, students who opted to take up third language after school should check with the CCA teacher-in-charge on the CCA training days to ensure there is no clash in CCA training and their third language lesson. Students should avoid selecting a CCA that holds their training on the same day as their third language lesson.

# Administrative Matters

**1. Will there be transport options available for my child in Dunman Secondary School?**

Our school does not provide school bus transport. Most of our students take public transport to come to school.

**2. We were unable to purchase the required textbook and learning materials for our child. Will there be an opportunity to purchase them in school in Term 1?**

Yes, the school bookshop will be open during curriculum hours for your child to purchase the required textbook and materials for their lessons.

**3. My child is unable to purchase the school’s PE shorts from the vendor website as they are out of stock, when would the next available purchase date be?**

The school uniform vendor will be available during the first two weeks of school. Students may purchase the PE attire at the bookshop beside the canteen during recess or after school lessons.

**4. What is the average pricing of food in the school canteen?**

Food in the school canteen ranges on an average from $2.00 - $3.50. Our school will continue to ensure meals are kept affordable, with subsidies provided through MOE or school-based support such as the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS).

**5. Where will I be able to get the details on the school fee for my child?**

Details on the school fee is made known online through the Ministry of Education (MOE) website at: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees?pt=2023](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees?pt=2023)

# CCA Matters

**1. Will there a chance for my child to try out different CCAs for a month before choosing their actual CCA that they will be staying with throughout their time in the school?**

During the 1st month of CCA selection till 20 January, students are strongly encouraged to join the CCA training with their seniors to find out more if it is their interest.

**2. Will my child be able to opt for an external CCA instead of participating in the CCAs provided by the school?**

As part of MOE overall holistic student development, all students will be allocated a School-based CCA and it is compulsory to participate in a school-based CCA. Students with external CCAs will need to make arrangements to prevent clash of school-based CCAs. At the same time, they may approach the HOD CCA & SH CCA for advice in their CCA selection, if they would like to continue in an external CCA.

**3. Is the STEM Mega CCA (i-STEM Club) offered one of the CCA options available for my child?**

For the i-STEM Club, there will be five components under this umbrella. In Secondary 1, all students will go through the foundation training and level 1 rotation for i-STEM. At the end of Secondary 1, the CCA students will specialise in one of the four components based on the i-STEM criteria.

**4. Will the students get an idea of the different CCA options before they pen down their choices for their CCA selection or attend an audition?**

The CCA auditions/trials held on 3 & 4 January, as well as the CCA Fair on 6 January are planned platforms for students to know the various components of each CCA. Senior students will also set up booths to target students’ interest. The school website is updated with the CCA overview and programme. 

During the 1st month of CCA selection till 20 January, students are strongly encouraged to join the cca trainings with seniors to find out more if it is their interest.

# PLD Matters

**1. Is my child able to use an existing family iPad as his PLD device?**

**2. Is the option to manage my child’s iPad using DMA similar to using the Apple’s own Parental Controls?**
