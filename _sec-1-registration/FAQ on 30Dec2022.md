# Student Management / Attire Questions

**1. Are the students allowed to bring handphones to school?**

In Dunman Secondary School we do allow students to bring their mobile phones to school along with specific rules and regulations pertaining of mobile phone usage in the school. 

There will be a discipline briefing for the students come during the first week of school and this briefing will include details on the rules with regards to mobile phone usage in our school. 

While there are various consequences when students misuse their mobile phones in school, we focus on discipline with care and we believe that discipline is an educative process where it is more than just getting students to go through the consequences with greater emphasis on ensuring they learn and reflect on their actions so that they will not commit the same offence again.
