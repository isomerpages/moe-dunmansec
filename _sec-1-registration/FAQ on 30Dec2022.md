# Student Management / Attire Questions

**1. Are the students allowed to bring handphones to school?**

In Dunman Secondary School we do allow students to bring their mobile phones to school along with specific rules and regulations pertaining of mobile phone usage in the school. 

There will be a discipline briefing for the students come during the first week of school and this briefing will include details on the rules with regards to mobile phone usage in our school. 

While there are various consequences when students misuse their mobile phones in school, we focus on discipline with care and we believe that discipline is an educative process where it is more than just getting students to go through the consequences with greater emphasis on ensuring they learn and reflect on their actions so that they will not commit the same offence again.

**2. What time is the reporting time for school?**

Students will report at 7:25am at the school parade square.

# Student Academic Development Questions

**1. What is the criteria for my child to take Pure Sciences and Combined Sciences in Secondary 3?**

We will provide students with Education & Career guidance throughout their years in Dunman to help them understand their strengths, interest and passion. At the end of Secondary 2, students will be placed in their preferred subject combination based on their strengths, learning aptitude and subject availability. Students taking Pure Sciences usually show strong academic abilities and passion in their Science and Maths. More details will be shared during Secondary 2 Streaming Talk for parents.

**2. Are there end-of-year examinations for my child?**

There are end-of-year examinations for all students in the school, including Secondary 1 students.

**3. How often is homework given to my child?**

Homework serves as a way for students to consolidate their learning and one of the platforms for us to give feedback. At the same time, we will ensure students are not overloaded with homework and the amount given is moderated.

**4. What if my childâ€™s third language lessons clash with their CCA training sessions?**

Third language lessons are held at external language centres once or twice a week. As these centres have their own lesson schedules, students who opted to take up third language after school should check with the CCA teacher-in-charge on the CCA training days to ensure there is no clash in CCA training and their third language lesson. Students should avoid selecting a CCA that holds their training on the same day as their third language lesson.
