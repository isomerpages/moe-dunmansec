Dear Secondary One Dunmanites,

<p style="text-align: justify;">Congratulations on your successful completion of your PSLE and for choosing to join our Dunman family.</p>

At Dunman Secondary, we<br>
***ASPIRE***  to bring out the best in you;<br>
***BUILD***  Dunmanites holistically by developing your character and equipping you with future-ready competencies beyond academics and<br>
***CARE***  for you as a valued member of our ONE Dunman Family.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the secondary school journey might seem challenging initially, with a wider range of subjects, Co-Curricular Activities and relatively longer school days, rest assured that your seniors and teachers will be there to support you and nurture you. We believe that every Dunmanite has the potential to grow into ethical leaders who make positive changes in the community.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To smoothen your transition from primary to secondary school life, our student leaders will be conducting our unique <b><i>One Dunman Experience</i></b>, a 3-day non-residential camp from <b><i>4 to 6 January 2023</i></b>  for our new Dunmanites.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to encourage you to invite your parents to join our Dedicated & Supportive Parent (DSP) Group. Our DSP is a strong network of parents who organises bonding activities for parents such as interest groups games, mental health webinar series and share good parenting strategies. Your parents’ involvement in school events also have a very positive impact on your growth and development at Dunman Secondary. We look forward to building a stronger home-school partnership with your parents.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I look forward to welcoming you personally on your first day on 3 January 2023 at Dunman Secondary.</p>

Mr Toh Thiam Chye<br>
Principal<br>
Dunman Secondary School
