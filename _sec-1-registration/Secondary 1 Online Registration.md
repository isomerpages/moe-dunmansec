<h4>3.&nbsp;Parents Gateway App</h4>

<p>Please view the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW9jwyuovOo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for step-by-step
guide to install the PG App.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4.&nbsp;Class Allocation</h4>
<p>Your child/ ward class allocation will be reflected on Parents Gateway
App by 27 December 2024. Alternatively, students can also view their class
allocation from the noticeboard placed outside school’s general office
during the first day of school.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have any additional queries, please contact the school’s
general office at 6786 2668. We look forward to working with you closely
in the best interests of your child/ ward as they embark on their Dunman
journey over the next four/ five years.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and understanding, we look forward to our partnership.</p>
