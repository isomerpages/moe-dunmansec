Dear Parent/ Guardian,

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are delighted that your child/ ward has chosen to be part of our Dunman family. We understand that this transition stage from primary to secondary school will be a new experience for him/ her. Hence, we have planned a series of programmes to help your child/ ward settle comfortably into the next exciting phase of his/ her growing years.</p>

#### 1.    Sec 1 e-Registration Form

<p style="text-align: justify;">We would require you to participate in the Sec 1 e-Registration Exercise by providing the school with necessary information by 23 December 2022 for our Secondary 1 Orientation Experience planning and for other administrative purposes.

#### 3.    Parents Gateway App

<p style="text-align: justify;">We will like to encourage parents/ guardians to download and install the Parents Gateway (PG) App. This is because we are using PG as our main mode of communication to all parents.</p>

#### 4.    Class Allocation

<p style="text-align: justify;">Your child/ ward class allocation will be reflected on Parents Gateway App after 23 December 2021. Alternatively, students can also view their class allocation from the noticeboard placed outside school’s general office during the first day of school.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, if you have any additional queries, please contact the school’s general office at 6786 2668. We look forward to working with you closely in the best interests of your child/ ward as they embark on their Dunman journey over the next four/ five years.</p>
