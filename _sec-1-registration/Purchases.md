#### Instructions for Onsite Purchase or Self-Collection of Textbooks and Uniforms In School


#### School Safe Management Measures

**(a)** All visitors (including students) are required to perform digital check-in/out via Safe Entry/Trace Together apps, in addition to existing school visitor registration process including temperature screening.  You are advised to arrive in school at least 10 min earlier than the self-collection time slot booked to cater time for this procedure.<br>
**(b)** Accompanying adults or students who are unwell should not enter the school and should reschedule their appointment.<br>
**(c)** After check-in/visitor registration, you will be directed to holding waiting areas while awaiting your turn to be served.

#### Parking Arrangement

As car parks in school are reserved for season parking holders, you may park your vehicle in nearby HDB carparks next to the school.  You may drive into the school to drop off or pick up passengers.
