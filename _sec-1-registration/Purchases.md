#### Instructions for Onsite Purchase or Self-Collection of Textbooks and Uniforms In School

**(a)** All visitors (including students) are required to perform digital check-in/out via Safe Entry/Trace Together apps, in addition to existing school visitor registration process including temperature screening.  You are advised to arrive in school at least 10 min earlier than the self-collection time slot booked to cater time for this procedure.<br>
**(b)** Accompanying adults or students who are unwell should not enter the school and should reschedule their appointment.<br>
**(c)** After check-in/visitor registration, you will be directed to holding waiting areas while awaiting your turn to be served.
