<p style="text-align: justify;">We are pleased to inform you that our school is onboard Parents Gateway since 2019. Parents Gateway (PG) is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage with schools, receive information more promptly, and perform a range of administrative functions more easily such as giving consent for school trips and make travel declaration. Recently, parents were updated on school precautionary measures taken to keep our students and staff safe, and ensure learning takes place for all.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have yet to download and activate the PG app on your mobile phone, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible.&nbsp;<b>Many parents have benefited from the use this app to stay updated on school’s programme and activities.</b> If you have difficulty activating the app, please contact Mr Azhar Wahab (ICT Manager).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>From 17 Feb 2020 onwards, the school will be using the PG app as the main communication channel with all parents.</b></p>
