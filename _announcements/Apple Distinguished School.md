<p>Dunman Secondary School is proud to announce its recognition as an Apple Distinguished School for the 2024â€“2027 programme term, joining 889 schools across 37 countries. This prestigious distinction is awarded to schools that demonstrate a strong commitment to continuous innovation in education and effectively use technology to inspire, reimagine, and enhance teaching and learning.

In these schools, visionary leaders and their communities collaborate to make a positive impact on teaching and learning. By integrating technology into their lessons, teachers empower students to take charge of their learning, discover new opportunities, and work towards a better world.
