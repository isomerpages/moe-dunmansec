<p>Every year in Dunman Secondary School, we celebrate Teachers' Day to acknowledge
and appreciate the passion and commitment of our teachers. We value the
multiple roles our teachers play in the lives of all our students.&nbsp;
During this special occasion, we would like parents and alumni members
to show your appreciation by posting messages of encouragement or affirmation
to our teachers.</p>
