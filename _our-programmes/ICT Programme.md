</li>
</ol>
<h3>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment</h3>
<p>ICT Department seeks to integrate ICT into curriculum, pedagogy and assessment
of subject disciplines and supporting resources. This will ensure ICT is
appropriately embedded at lesson design.</p>
<p>In addition, we seek to integrate technology into subject areas learning,
harness technology possibilities for assessment and national examinations,
providing reach and support beyond classroom learning as well as educating
the digital learners.</p>
<p>To bring about deeper integration of ICT into the Curriculum, Assessment
and Pedagogy, we seek to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>integrate ICT into National Curriculum,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide quality online learning resources for students,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporate ICT in Assessment,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen Digital Learning: Cyber Wellness and New Media Literacy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programmes and Activities</h3>
<h4>Sec 1 IMDA Lab on Wheels</h4>
<p>Lab on Wheels aims to ignite passion and make exploration of tech fun
and engaging for our students to be future ready digital citizens in Singapore’s
Smart Nation. The experiential and interactive tech showcases enable students
to imagine the possibilities that emerging and future technologies could
bring to better everyday lives.</p>
<h4>Sec 1 Mac Experience Workshop</h4>
<p>All Sec 1 students will undergo a 2 hours introductory workshop in the
use of Macintosh computers and its suite of productive and creative applications.</p>
<h4>Sec 1 Media Literacy Programme (MLP)</h4>
<p>The objective of the Media Literacy Programme (MLP) is to introduce and
equip our students with the necessary media literacy skills so as to prepare
them for a future where social and work literacy and competencies are increasingly
being re-configured in web-based and media-centric environments.</p>
<p>Media literacy refers to “the ability to access, analyse, evaluate and
create media in a variety of forms”. This definition affirms the need for
a media-literate person to both understand (critique/analyse) and produce
(create) media. Hence, the media literacy programme will aim to nurture
media-literate students who can critically evaluate and create media on
their own. The design of the MLP, including curriculum is guided by the
following key principles.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All media messages are ‘constructed’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each media has its unique creative language with its own rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All messages are culturally mediated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media have embedded values and both overt and covert ideologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media messages have intent as well as implications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The MLP will focus on the essential media literacy, as well as skills
to handle cyber wellness issues. Basic media literacy include the ability
to access, analyse, evaluate and create print as well as non-print media
in a variety of forms, such as interpreting sources in newspapers, websites,
creating a blog or webpage, posting original artwork, photography, stories
and videos online, or remixing online content to create new products.</p>
<h4>Sec 1 G Suite for Education (Google)</h4>
<p>All Sec 1 students will undergo a 2 hours workshop where they learn to
use Google Classroom and the suite of tools designed to empower teachers
and students as they learn and innovate together.</p>
<h4>Sec 2 Code for Fun (Scratch)</h4>
<p>All Sec 2 students will undergo a 4 hours workshop where they learn to
create animations through visual programming software.</p>
<p>Code for Fun is our platform to increase students' exposure to coding
and computational thinking.</p>
<h4>Sec 2 ICT-Driven Project Work</h4>
<p><strong>Mobile Apps Making (GameSalad), Micro:bit Programming (Let’s Code) and 3D Printing (Tinkercad)</strong>
</p>
<p>All secondary 2 students will undergo one semester of Project Work. There
is an IT training component in their Project Work (PW) where they learn
to create science-related Apple Apps through coding software, to create
programs using Micro:bit or to create 3D printed artefact through 3D modelling
software; as innovative products and solutions for defined problems they
experience, to improve the quality of life in a SMART ecosystem or for
sustainable living.</p>
<p>ICT-Driven project work develops pupils' learning in two ways, Self-Directed
Learning (SDL) and Collaborative Learning (CoL). Knowledge application
and communication skills are essential for such learning to take place.</p>
<p>SDL is one critical process as pupils need to research on information
that will be used as contents in their apps. SDL allows students to make
meanings and to construct their own understanding of a concept or real-life
situation.</p>
<p>CoL, on the other hand, requires students to be an active and effective
co-worker in a group. Pupils, in groups, synthesize their new found knowledge
and to create their understanding of the subject collaboratively. CoL calls
for good and effective communication amongst its team members.</p>
<p>The innovative products/solutions will be showcased at Open House where
public can get to see and experience our students’ creations. There will
also be make and play zone for them to create boats using 3D drawing pens
and to take part in racing competitions.</p>
<p>The most innovation product/solution will be awarded the Basil Victor
George (Innovation) Award at our annual Dunman Appreciation Day.</p>
<h4>Sec 3 Productivity Tools (Microsoft)</h4>
<p>All Sec 3 students will undergo a 2 hours training workshop in the use
of word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software. Amazon Web Service
(AWS) Accelerator Program The AWS Accelerator Programme is a fully-sponsored
programme for students enrolled in local Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges.
It is jointly organised by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and SG Code Campus,
supported by Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA),
Dunman Secondary School; and organisations that include Farrer Park Hospital
Singapore, Seoul Garden and National Parks. This exciting initiative aimed
at introducing students to cutting edge Machine/Deep Learning capabilities
on the AWS Cloud is in its third year. During the programme, participants
have the opportunity to pick up advanced programming languages such as
Python and apply their knowledge in areas related to Cloud Computing and
Deep Learning. They work on real world challenges provided by industries
in areas such as F&amp;B, healthcare, environment, sustainability, and
technology. Participants then create solutions for the industries and showcase
them at a graduation ceremony attended by industry partners, educators
and their parents.</p>
<p>How have students benefited from AWS?</p>

on their one-year journey into the programme</p>
<h4>Youth Digital Currency Programme</h4>
<p>Our school leverages on Educational Technology (EdTech) and our partnership
with tertiary institutions to build an integrated curriculum. One of our
initiatives is the Youth Digital Currency Programme (YDCP) which aims to
ignite students’ passion for STEM-related courses in tertiary education
and also to develop 21st Century Competencies in areas of critical and
inventive thinking, communication, collaboration and information skills.
These future-ready skills go beyond traditional classroom knowledge and
are crucial in preparing our students to navigate the technology and innovation
driven world.</p>
<p>YDCP is a collaboration between Dunman Secondary School and Temasek Polytechnic
and is a 120-hours long program (approximately a year) to build computational
thinking skills in our students through data analytics with Artificial
Intelligence and Predictive Analytics; and data visualisation with dashboard
web development in Python.</p>
<p>Our inaugural program started in April 2022, and our first batch of 22
students graduated in March 2023. This year-long program requires students
to be committed and self-regulated, exemplifying our school values – Determination
and Discipline.</p>
<p>Students build their digital portfolio, documenting their skills and competencies
and then showcase their products. The digital portfolio helps students
to be successful with their Early Admission Exercise applications for Polytechnics.</p>
<p>After the initial success in our first year in 2022, we extended the programme
to include students from two other schools within our East Zone cluster
schools (East Spring and Springfield Secondary), and opportunities were
given to more students to participate in the programme.</p>
