### Mission / Objectives of Department
1. Students as Innovative and Discerning users of IT.
2. To provide the infrastructure support and learning resources that will enable effective teaching and learning.
3. To integrate IT in the instructional programme in order to facilitate the development of 21st Century Competencies and to empower students in becoming effective life-long learners.
4. To lead in creating a SMART school.
5. To lead and foster a learning community among teachers in the teaching and learning with technology.

### Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment
<p style="text-align: justify;">ICT Department seeks to integrate ICT into curriculum, pedagogy and assessment of subject disciplines and supporting resources. This will ensure ICT is appropriately embedded at lesson design.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, we seek to integrate technology into subject areas learning, harness technology possibilities for assessment and national examinations, providing reach and support beyond classroom learning as well as educating the digital learners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To bring about deeper integration of ICT into the Curriculum, Assessment and Pedagogy, we seek to:</p>

* integrate ICT into National Curriculum,
* provide quality online learning resources for students,
* incorporate ICT in Assessment,
* deepen Digital Learning: Cyber Wellness and New Media Literacy.

### Programmes and Activities
#### Sec 1 IMDA Lab on Wheels
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lab on Wheels aims to ignite passion and make exploration of tech fun and engaging for our students to be future ready digital citizens in Singapore’s Smart Nation. The experiential and interactive tech showcases enable students to imagine the possibilities that emerging and future technologies could bring to better everyday lives.</p>

#### Sec 1 Mac Experience Workshop
<p style="text-align: justify;">All Sec 1 students will undergo a 2 hours introductory workshop in the use of Macintosh computers and its suite of productive and creative applications.</p>

#### Sec 1 Media Literacy Programme (MLP)
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the Media Literacy Programme (MLP) is to introduce and equip our students with the necessary media literacy skills so as to prepare them for a future where social and work literacy and competencies are increasingly being re-configured in web-based and media-centric environments.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Media literacy refers to “the ability to access, analyse, evaluate and create media in a variety of forms”. This definition affirms the need for a media-literate person to both understand (critique/analyse) and produce (create) media. Hence, the media literacy programme will aim to nurture media-literate students who can critically evaluate and create media on their own. The design of the MLP, including curriculum is guided by the following key principles.</p>

* All media messages are ‘constructed’
* Each media has its unique creative language with its own rules
* All messages are culturally mediated
* Media have embedded values and both overt and covert ideologies
* Media messages have intent as well as implications

<p style="text-align: justify;">The MLP will focus on the essential media literacy, as well as skills to handle cyber wellness issues. Basic media literacy include the ability to access, analyse, evaluate and create print as well as non-print media in a variety of forms, such as interpreting sources in newspapers, websites, creating a blog or webpage, posting original artwork, photography, stories and videos online, or remixing online content to create new products.</p>


#### Sec 1 G Suite for Education (Google)
<p style="text-align: justify;">All Sec 1 students will undergo a 2 hours workshop where they learn to use Google Classroom and the suite of tools designed to empower teachers and students as they learn and innovate together.</p>

#### Sec 2 Code for Fun (Scratch)
<p style="text-align: justify;">All Sec 2 students will undergo a 4 hours workshop where they learn to create animations through visual programming software.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Code for Fun is our platform to increase students' exposure to coding and computational thinking.</p>

#### Sec 2 ICT-Driven Project Work
**Mobile Apps Making (GameSalad), Micro:bit Programming (Let’s Code) and 3D Printing (Tinkercad)**
<p style="text-align: justify;">All secondary 2 students will undergo one semester of Project Work. There is an IT training component in their Project Work (PW) where they learn to create science-related Apple Apps through coding software, to create programs using Micro:bit or to create 3D printed artefact through 3D modelling software; as innovative products and solutions for defined problems they experience, to improve the quality of life in a SMART ecosystem or for sustainable living.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">ICT-Driven project work develops pupils' learning in two ways, Self-Directed Learning (SDL) and Collaborative Learning (CoL). Knowledge application and communication skills are essential for such learning to take place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">SDL is one critical process as pupils need to research on information that will be used as contents in their apps. SDL allows students to make meanings and to construct their own understanding of a concept or real-life situation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">CoL, on the other hand, requires students to be an active and effective co-worker in a group. Pupils, in groups, synthesize their new found knowledge and to create their understanding of the subject collaboratively. CoL calls for good and effective communication amongst its team members.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The innovative products/solutions will be showcased at Open House where public can get to see and experience our students’ creations. There will also be make and play zone for them to create boats using 3D drawing pens and to take part in racing competitions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most innovation product/solution will be awarded the Basil Victor George (Innovation) Award at our annual Dunman Appreciation Day.</p>

#### Sec 3 Productivity Tools (Microsoft)
All Sec 3 students will undergo a 2 hours training workshop in the use of word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software.
Amazon Web Service (AWS) Accelerator Program
The AWS Accelerator Programme is a fully-sponsored programme for students enrolled in local Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges. It is jointly organised by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and SG Code Campus, supported by Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA), Dunman Secondary School; and organisations that include Farrer Park Hospital Singapore, Seoul Garden and National Parks.
This exciting initiative aimed at introducing students to cutting edge Machine/Deep Learning capabilities on the AWS Cloud is in its third year. 
During the programme, participants have the opportunity to pick up advanced programming languages such as Python and apply their knowledge in areas related to Cloud Computing and Deep Learning. They work on real world challenges provided by industries in areas such as F&amp;B, healthcare, environment, sustainability, and technology. Participants then create solutions for the industries and showcase them at a graduation ceremony attended by industry partners, educators and their parents.

How have students benefited from AWS?

#### Youth Digital Currency Programme
Our school leverages on Educational Technology (EdTech) and our partnership with tertiary institutions to build an integrated curriculum. One of our initiatives is the Youth Digital Currency Programme (YDCP) which aims to ignite students’ passion for STEM-related courses in tertiary education and also to develop 21st Century Competencies in areas of critical and inventive thinking, communication, collaboration and information skills. These future-ready skills go beyond traditional classroom knowledge and are crucial in preparing our students to navigate the technology and innovation driven world.

YDCP is a collaboration between Dunman Secondary School and Temasek Polytechnic and is a 120-hours long program (approximately a year) to build computational thinking skills in our students through data analytics with Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Analytics; and data visualisation with dashboard web development in Python.

Our inaugural program started in April 2022, and our first batch of 22 students graduated in March 2023. This year-long program requires students to be committed and self-regulated, exemplifying our school values – Determination and Discipline.

Students build their digital portfolio, documenting their skills and competencies and then showcase their products. The digital portfolio helps students to be successful with their Early Admission Exercise applications for Polytechnics.

After the initial success in our first year in 2022, we extended the programme to include students from two other schools within our East Zone cluster schools (East Spring and Springfield Secondary), and opportunities were given to more students to participate in the programme.
