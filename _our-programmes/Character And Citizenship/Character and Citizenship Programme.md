# Values in Action (VIA) 

Values in Action (VIA) is an essential Student Development Experience (SDE) designed to cultivate socially responsible individuals who make a positive impact on their communities. It focuses on teaching and applying values, knowledge, and skills while encouraging student ownership and initiative. Through VIA, students are invited to reflect on their experiences, the values they've enacted, and explore ways to sustain their meaningful contributions.

# Secondary 1
Students participate in the STEMviaDT program, which introduces them to Design Thinking concepts that they apply in their projects. These projects concentrate on the theme of self-care, specifically addressing aspects such as sleep, mental well-being, nutrition, and physical activity. Throughout the program, students acquire valuable skills by utilizing Figma to develop prototypes that mimic mobile screen interfaces. Additionally, they engage in 3D modeling, allowing them to use a 3D printer to transform their ideas into tangible objects. This hands-on approach not only fosters creativity but also enhances their understanding of design and technology in real-world applications

# Secondary 2
are engaged in the STEMviaDT program, which allows them to revisit and deepen their understanding of Design Thinking concepts through practical application in their projects. Their initiatives focus on sustainability, addressing critical issues such as water conservation and electricity savings. As part of this program, students acquire essential skills by learning two coding methodologies: block-based coding and text-based coding. Utilizing microbits, they are able to develop functioning prototypes that enhance their presentations. This hands-on experience not only reinforces their technical abilities but also emphasizes the importance of innovative solutions to promote environmental sustainability.

# Secondary 3
Classes actively participate in the community partnership program, collaborating closely with our community partners to design and execute a Values in Action (VIA) event that serves specific beneficiaries. This initiative provides students with the opportunity to work together as a cohesive class, fostering teamwork and a sense of shared responsibility. By engaging in this program, students not only enhance their understanding of social responsibility but also contribute positively to the community. Their collective efforts exemplify the importance of civic engagement and underscore the value of collaboration in achieving meaningful outcomes for those in need

# Secondary 4
Students, in collaboration with the National Library Board, organize outreach event aimed at engaging the neighborhood in a positive and informative manner. The event covers essential topics such as the processes involved in farming, the growth of plants, and the origins of our food production. A primary emphasis of this outreach initiative is sustainability, highlighting the importance of environmentally responsible practices. Through this program, students will facilitate discussions that encourage community members to reflect on their relationship with food and the environment, fostering a deeper understanding of sustainable practices within the context of local agriculture.
