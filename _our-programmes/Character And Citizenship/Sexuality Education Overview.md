<h3><strong>Moe Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd)
in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social
and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and
rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of the
opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit
of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and
stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching
and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support
students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes
as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide
students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students
develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having
positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised
on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and
respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<h4><strong>Overview of DUNMAN SECONDARY SCHOOL’S Sexuality Education Programme for 2025</strong></h4>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality
Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and
Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for more
information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality
include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our
youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure
to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex
stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity
and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle
adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period
for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities
(including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant
consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer
acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act
responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from
within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense
of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education
lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive
self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and
repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality,
which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">At Dunman Secondary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in <u>2025</u>:</a></strong>

different emotional and physical boundaries. This lesson highlights the
need to respect the boundaries of others and reinforces the importance
of showing respect to the opposite sex by using appropriate words and actions.
Students will examine personal boundaries from different perspectives and
learn the importance of making sound values-based decisions and acting
in consideration of the well-being of themselves and others.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;<em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>eTeens</em> is a programme developed
by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education,
to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV
and protection from a health perspective. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in
two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. The
desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are empowered
to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such
as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and
negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends
beyond themselves and involves their family, and the importance of responsible
decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values
are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Dunman Secondary School, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:</strong>
