### Mission / Objectives of Department
  
The Craft & Technology department  is committed to motivate and engage our learners. We firmly believe every child can learn but more importantly, we ensure that the child enjoys the learning process. Through the process, we seek to instill values like determination, perseverance, respect, time management and teamwork in our learners.

### Vision Of The Department

Students who can be nurtured to appreciate and enjoy the aesthetics and culture in their environment and are willing to use the skills which they have learnt to serve and give back to the community.  

#### Teachers
To develop a supportive and nurturing environment where teachers are bonded and are willing to help and take care of each other’s  wellbeing to continue to grow together as OneDunman.

### Curriculum, Pedagogy & Assessment

Craft and Technology Department (C&T) comprises Four subjects area;
* Design & Technology (D&T – Lower and Upper Sec)
* Nutrition & Food Science (NFS - Upper Sec) / Food Consumer Education (FCE - Lower Sec)
* Art (Lower Sec)
* Music (Lower Sec)

Craft & Technology is a compulsory-based subject for the lower secondary levels where students get to experience making prototypes using the design process in D&T; research on nutrition and learn the techniques of cooking in FCE, produce interesting artwork pieces (both physical & digital) in ART and create and perform local Music as well as harness the use of IT in music composition in MUSIC. The main aim is to challenge students to think out of the box and be creative in their design ideas, food recipes, art pieces and music creation.

The main approach that teachers adopt in engaging student learning are **Design Thinking and Inquiry based learning**. Through Design Thinking, students are taught to empathize with the user and look at the problem from various perspective to tackle them. Through  **Authentic learning**, students get to learn the concepts and make the connections so that the lesson becomes alive and are more self-directed in their learning. A range of both Formative and Summative assessments are used to assess student learning and understanding so that progress is made.

For the lower sec D&T programme, the students will need observe and research around the school and are tasked to ideate via sketching and mock-up to develop a prototype to address the problem. Through the curriculum, students will learn to think critically, communicate their ideas via sketching and make a prototype using 3 resistive materials (i.e. Acrylic, Wood and Metal).
