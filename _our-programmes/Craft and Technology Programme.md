### Mission / Objectives of Department

The Craft &amp; Technology department is a closely-knit department where every teacher contributes willingly and selflessly to motivate and engage students to learn in class. We firmly believe every child can learn and we work hard at ensuring that the child not only learns but most importantly enjoys the learning process. Through the process, we hope to instill and nurture our students with values like determination, perseverance, respect, time management and teamwork which will see them through their journey in life.

### Vision of the Department

**Students**

The Department aims to develop students to become empathetic, self-directed learners, critical and innovative problem solvers who can face and handle life challenges confidently. We also aim to nurture students to appreciate and enjoy the aesthetics and culture in their environment and are willing to use the skills which they have learnt to serve and give back to the community.

### Teachers

The Department aims to develop a supportive and nurturing environment where teachers are bonded and are willing to help and take care of one another’s well-being so as to continue to grow together as OneDunman.

**Curriculum, Pedagogy &amp; Assessment**

Craft and Technology Department (C&amp;T) comprises of Four Subjects area;&nbsp;

*   Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T – Lower and Upper Sec)&nbsp;
    
*   Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS - Upper Sec) / Food Consumer Education (FCE - Lower Sec)&nbsp;
    
*   Art (Lower Sec)&nbsp;
    
*   Music (Lower Sec)
    

These subjects are common curriculum based subject for the lower secondary levels where students get to experience making prototype using the design process in D&amp;T; research on nutrition and learn the techniques of cooking in FCE, produce interesting artwork pieces (both physical &amp; digital) in ART and create and perform music from the Singapore and global cultures as well as harness the use of IT in music composition in MUSIC. The main aim is to challenge students to think out of the box and be creative in their design ideas, food recipes, art pieces and music creation.

The main approach that teachers adopt in engaging student learning are Design Thinking and Inquiry based learning. Through Design Thinking, students are taught to empathize with the user and look at the problem from various perspective to tackle them. Through the usage of Authentic learning, students get to learn the concepts and make the connections so that the lesson becomes alive to them and hence they are more self-directed in their learning. A range of both Formative and Summative assessments are used to assess students’ learning and understanding so that progress is made.

### Design &amp; Technology

**Ideation/ Sketching**

For the lower sec D&amp;T programme, the students will need to observe the school surroundings, conduct a research around the school and ideate via sketching and mock-up to develop a prototype to address a problem which they see. Through the curriculum, students will learn to think critically, communicate their ideas via sketching and make prototype using 3 resistive materials (i.e. Acrylic, Wood and Metal).

**Sec 3 Learning Journey**

In our Upper Secondary curriculum, the Design and Technology programme takes a unique approach to teaching the design process. We believe in hands-on learning, collaboration, and real-world experiences to ignite the creative spark in our Sec 3 students. To achieve this, we take the students on learning journeys.

Every year, D&amp;T unit will organize exciting learning journey (helmed by Ms Chayarnee, teacher in-charge for 2023 &amp; 2024) and brought our students to the iconic Ikea Singapore store (2023) and Red Dot Museum (2024). The focus was on understanding anthropometry, ergonomics, users’ needs, and design considerations. Through a gamified approach using the GooseChase app, students worked in teams to complete tasks that included taking pictures, providing short answers, creating videos, and sketching ideas.

This immersive experience not only made learning engaging but also translated theory into practice. Our students left with a deeper understanding of the design process and honed skills that will serve them well in their future endeavors.

In Design and Technology, we believe in learning by doing, and our students have proven, time and again, that this approach sparks their creativity and passion for design.

### Food and Consumer Education (FCE)

**Healthy Chicken Rice**

Students in lower FCE programme are engaged in problem-based learning activities whereby they are given case studies of people with certain health conditions and to research on and work out suitable healthy meals. They will learn various noteworthy nutritional facts and perform practical cooking sessions to whip up significant dishes. They will then use their acquired knowledge to come up with interesting recipes in their FCE lessons. <p></p>

### Art (Lower Secondary)

**Students looking at the Virtual Art Gallery**

A Virtual Art Exhibition called “The Sound of Colour” was set up (helmed by Ms Nurmasnita, teacher in-charge) to display the Sec 1 Students’ Artworks. Through this immersive experience, these young artists have not only harnessed their auditory senses but also drawn inspiration from the brilliant works of Wassily Kandinsky. This exhibition serves as a profound lesson in effective communication through art.

The students have discovered the power of technology, witnessing how it can elevate the art of ideation and expression by using the digital tools like the Sketchbook App and iMovie. With these tools, the students crafted their designs and meticulously documented their creative journey. This exploration has unlocked a wealth of visual possibilities, as they experimented with an array of tools and functions.

To enhance their gallery experience, the students were provided with VR Goggles, immersing themselves fully in their artistic world. Additionally, the students have embarked on a gallery lesson, diligently filling out worksheets to capture and reflect upon their experiences.<p></p>

### Music (Lower Secondary)

![](/images/Department%20Photos/Craft%20&amp;%20Tech/insert_Pic_14.png)

In Music, students will develop the skills to listen and respond to Music, create Music in both vocal and instrumental settings, individually and collaboratively and perform Music in both vocal and instrumental settings, individually and collaboratively. In particular, Secondary 1 students learn to play the Ukulele – a small four-stringed guitar of Hawaiian origin, as well as the Cajon – an instrument which originates from Peru. They will be given the opportunities to showcase their skills during group performances. The students will also be taught to appreciate music from global and the Singapore cultures. They will experience and perform a variety of community songs that can be heard in Singapore and be familiar with local musicians, composers and performers. They will then present their rendition of these songs during the Sec 1 cohort recess.

For Secondary 2, the students will use their creative ideas to come up with covers of their favourite songs and to perform these songs using digital tools like Garageband, which is available in their Personal Learning Device. To further enhance the music experience of students, they will write their own lyrics and compose their own music through the use of Garageband. A mini performance will be held in the canteen for them to showcase their compositions.

**NFS and D&amp;T (UPPER SECONDARY)**

For the Upper Secondary Programme, only NFS and D&amp;T are offered as electives to students and the subjects are taught independently to prepare the pupils for the GCE 'N' and 'O' Level Examinations. The subjects are coursework based whereby pupils are to research and design an artefact for D&amp;T and design nutrition meals for NFS. In the aim to enhance student's learning, field trips and enrichment classes are also organised to expose students to the different learning environments.
