### Mission/ Objectives of Department

<p style="text-align: justify;">The department is committed to developing all Dunmanites to be effective and empathetic communicators who appreciate the English language, its literatures and cultures and who use the language creatively, critically, competently and ethically. The department also strives to develop all teachers of the English Language and/or English Literature to possess subject mastery and deliver effective and innovative teaching strategies that will imbue a love of learning for themselves and their students alike.</p>

### Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are expected to acquire different learning objectives at various stages of their secondary school course. Generally, these objectives fall into four broad domains of learning:</p>

* Communication and Language Development
* Thinking Skills
* Learning How to Learn
* Language and Culture

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through the use of innovative and engaging pedagogies like Differentiated Instruction, the Gradual Release of Responsibility and Learning Study teachers aim to achieve these objectives and develop 21st century competencies in the learner.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The learnerâ€™s progress is assessed holistically and classroom assessment is generally divided into three types: assessment for learning, assessment of learning and assessment as learning. The department also aims to provide varied and authentic learning experiences that are both meaningful and engaging for the learners. </p>

### Programmes and Activities

#### 1) Oral Communication Programme

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our oracy programme aims to develop empathetic communicators who possess the values, dispositions and skills to listen actively to different perspectives, communicate confidently, effectively and sensitively while collaborating with others to work towards shared goals through cohort-based platforms and other school-wide presentation platforms. The cohort-based oracy programmes also aim to develop creative inquirers who explore and evaluate real-world issues and multiple perspectives, as well as gather and synthesise information from diverse print, non-print and digital networked sources, so as to co-create knowledge and solutions in familiar or new contexts.

#### Activities

**1) Learning Journeys**
The department strives to enrich the students' learning experience beyond the confines of the classroom and learning journeys will be planned for the students along the year as and when possible.

**2) Speak Good English and Live(L)it Week**
During the annual Speak Good English Week and Live(L)it Week a plethora of exciting activities are lined up for the students to encourage them to converse and write good and proper English and to spark a love for Literature. Some of these include cohort-based language games and activities, talks by local writers, book fairs by vendors and internal competitions. The yearly affair culminates with the much-anticipated event: Books Come Alive@Dunman. Dunman undergoes a vibrant transformation each year when students and teachers alike don the outfits of famous characters from literary books, impersonating their chosen characters both in appearance and behaviour.

**3) Talent Development Initiatives **

Selection and training of students for external and internal competitions and courses
