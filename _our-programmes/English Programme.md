<h3>Mission / Objectives of Department</h3>
<p>The department is committed to developing all Dunmanites to be effective
and empathetic communicators who appreciate the English language, its literatures
and cultures and who use the language creatively, critically, competently
and ethically. The department also strives to develop all teachers of the
English Language and/or English Literature to possess subject mastery and
deliver effective and innovative teaching strategies that will imbue a
love of learning for themselves and their students alike.</p>
<h3>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment</h3>
<p>Students are expected to acquire different learning objectives at various
stages of their secondary school course. Generally, these objectives fall
into four broad domains of learning:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Communication and Language Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking Skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning How to Learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language and Culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the use of innovative and engaging pedagogies like Differentiated
Instruction, the Gradual Release of Responsibility and Learning Study teachers
aim to achieve these objectives and develop 21st century competencies in
the learner.</p>
<p>The learner’s progress is assessed holistically and classroom assessment
is generally divided into three types: assessment for learning, assessment
of learning and assessment as learning. The department also aims to provide
varied and authentic learning experiences that are both meaningful and
engaging for the learners.</p>
<h3>Programmes and Activities</h3>
<h4>Oral Communication Programme</h4>
<p>Our oracy programme aims to develop empathetic communicators who possess
the values, dispositions and skills to listen actively to different perspectives,
communicate confidently, effectively and sensitively while collaborating
with others to work towards shared goals through cohort-based platforms
and other school-wide presentation platforms. The cohort-based oracy programmes
also aim to develop creative inquirers who explore and evaluate real-world
issues and multiple perspectives, as well as gather and synthesise information
from diverse print, non-print and digital networked sources, so as to co-create
knowledge and solutions in familiar or new contexts.</p>
<h4>Activities</h4>
<p><strong>1) Learning Journeys</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>The department strives to enrich the students' learning experience beyond
the confines of the classroom and learning journeys will be planned for
the students along the year as and when possible. In particular, our students
are given exposure to appreciate authentic theatre experiences.</p>
<p><strong>2) Speak Good English and Live(L)it Week</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>During the annual Speak Good English Week and Live(L)it Week a plethora
of exciting activities are lined up for the students to encourage them
to converse and write good and proper English and to spark a love for Literature.
Some of these include cohort-based language games and activities, talks
by local writers, book fairs by vendors and internal competitions. The
yearly affair culminates with the much-anticipated event: Books Come Alive@Dunman.
Dunman undergoes a vibrant transformation each year when students and teachers
alike don the outfits of famous characters from literary books, impersonating
their chosen characters both in appearance and behaviour.</p>
