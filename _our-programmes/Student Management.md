### Philosophy on Student Development & Management

To promote a safe & conducive environment and discipline with care & dignity.

### Student Development & Management Approaches

The school adopts a whole-school, multi-pronged approach to student development and management through the following key strategies:

1.  **Whole School Approach** through involving all staff and students in establishing supportive policies, systems and practices.  
    
2.  Building a **culture of care** through establishing positive school and school classroom environments in which students feel safe and cared for and have a sense of belonging to the school.  

3.  Delivering **structured Character & Citizenship Education Programme** that teach and provide opportunities for application of values and skills necessary for demonstrating positive behaviours.  
  
4.  Providing **intervention support** for specific groups of students who require help in managing their behaviours and address unmet developmental and intrapersonal needs.    
    
5.  Providing **capacity building opportunities for teachers** to enable them to carry out their disciplinary role effectively.
