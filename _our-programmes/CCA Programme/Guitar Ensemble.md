### Introduction

![](/images/CCA%20Photos/Guitar%20Ensemble/syf%20stage%201.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dunman Guitar Ensemble, led by instructor Mr. Kevin Yeo, is a prominent performing arts CCA in the school. The Dunman Guitar Ensemble adopts the Niibori Instrumentation that hails from Fujisawa, Tokyo. The variety of guitars used in our ensemble follows that of an orchestra and are known as the Soprano, Alto, Alto Cembalo, Prime, Bass, Contrabass and even the Guitarron! These guitars produce very different sounds, which widen the orchestral range of the songs produced by the Ensemble, and allow them to produce much more refined and interesting music. This is definitely a unique feature of Dunman's Guitar Ensemble, as not every school has such a privilege.</p>

### Trainings 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our practices are held on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. New songs are frequently being introduced to the students, so they are always learning new pieces, and will never get bored of old ones. Different genres of songs are played by the ensemble, from classical pieces such as ‘Eine Kleine Nachtmusik’ 1st Movement by Mozart, ‘Mountains in Autumn’ by by Urato Watanabe, to Japanese anisong created for Japanese anime series ‘Cruels Angel’s Thesis’ by Yoko Takahashi and even modern pop pieces like ‘Sugar’. These songs relate very much to the members and they definitely enjoy playing it as well. The lively and enthusiastic atmosphere of the ensemble in each practice never fails to bring a smile to every one of the members' faces, as they laugh, learn and enjoy the music together.
The Dunman Guitar Ensemble, which encompasses fun and valuable learning opportunities, allows one to not only benefit from it, but create unforgettable memories in one’s secondary school experience as well!
