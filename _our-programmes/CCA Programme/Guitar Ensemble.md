<p>The Dunman Guitar Ensemble, led by instructor Mr. Kevin Yeo, is a prominent
performing arts CCA in the school. The Dunman Guitar Ensemble adopts the
Niibori Instrumentation that hails from Fujisawa, Tokyo. The variety of
guitars used in our ensemble follows that of an orchestra and are known
as the Soprano, Alto, Alto Cembalo, Prime, Bass, Contrabass and even the
Guitarron! These guitars produce very different sounds, which widen the
orchestral range of the songs produced by the Ensemble, and allow them
to produce much more refined and interesting music. This is definitely
a unique feature of Dunman's Guitar Ensemble, as not every school has such
a privilege.</p>

<p>On 22 March 2024, we had our inaugural guitar concert held in our school!
The setlist was curated by the members for their parents and friends and
the hundred tickets were all snapped up. It was huge success for the ensemble
as the event was so well-received.</p>
<h3>Trainings</h3>
<p>Our practices are held on Tuesday and Friday afternoons. New songs are
frequently being introduced to the students, so they are always learning
new pieces, and will never get bored of old ones. Different genres of songs
are played by the ensemble, from classical pieces such as ‘Eine Kleine
Nachtmusik’ 1st Movement by Mozart, ‘Mountains in Autumn’ by by Urato Watanabe,
to Japanese anisong created for Japanese anime series ‘Cruels Angel’s Thesis’
by Yoko Takahashi and even modern pop pieces like ‘Sugar’. These songs
relate very much to the members and they definitely enjoy playing it as
well. The lively and enthusiastic atmosphere of the ensemble in each practice
never fails to bring a smile to every one of the members' faces, as they
laugh, learn and enjoy the music together. The Dunman Guitar Ensemble,
which encompasses fun and valuable learning opportunities, allows one to
not only benefit from it, but create unforgettable memories in one’s secondary
school experience as well!</p>
