### Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dunman Guitar Ensemble, led by instructor Mr. Kevin Yeo, is a prominent performing arts CCA in the school. The Dunman Guitar Ensemble adopts the Niibori Instrumentation that hails from Fujisawa, Tokyo. The variety of guitars used in our ensemble follows that of an orchestra and are known as the Soprano, Alto, Alto Cembalo, Prime, Bass, Contrabass and even the Guitarron! These guitars produce very different sounds, which widen the orchestral range of the songs produced by the Ensemble, and allow them to produce much more refined and interesting music. This is definitely a unique feature of Dunman's Guitar Ensemble, as not every school has such a privilege.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dunman Guitar Ensemble has often been invited to perform for school events and public events. For instance, the ensemble performed at the Esplanade Concourse in November 2014 and July 2016. We also hold our Joint Concerts with other Performing Arts CCAs at the PLMGSS Auditorium in 2016 and at the Esplanade Concert Hall in 2018. In 2019, the Dunman Guitar Ensemble was invited to perform at The Ship for Southeast Asian Youth Programme (SSEAYP) with her Excellency Halimah Yacob, President of Singapore, as the Guest of Honour.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, the Guitar Ensemble even had the chance to travel to Melbourne, Australia, to perform and learn from likewise musicians. This trip not only provided members with a fun & interesting learning experience, but also gave them a greater chance to bond with one another.</p>

### Trainings 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Practices are held every week on Tuesdays & Thursdays from 3-6pm, where new songs are frequently being introduced to the students, so they are always learning new pieces, and will never get bored of old ones. Different genres of songs are played by the ensemble, from classical pieces such as ‘Symphony No. 1’ by Felix Mendelssohn to folk pieces such as ‘Yagibushi’, a Japanese Folk Song by Masaaki Hayakawa and even modern pop pieces like “Haru Haru”, "Little Talks" and "Safe & Sound". These songs relate very much to the members and they definitely enjoy playing it as well. The lively and enthusiastic atmosphere of the ensemble in each practice never fails to bring a smile to every one of the members' faces, as they laugh, learn and enjoy the music together.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dunman Guitar Ensemble, which encompasses fun and valuable learning opportunities, allows one to not only benefit from it, but create unforgettable memories in one’s secondary school experience as well!</p>
