<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Dunman Concert Band has always been a distinguished CCA in the history
of our school. Founded in 1969, it consists of three instrumental families:
Brass, Percussion and Woodwind. The Band strongly believes that every student
can learn to play an instrument, can learn to work well with others as
a team, and can learn to contribute to the success of the Band. We consistently
strive for excellence in all we do, and we operate within an environment
of deeply-ingrained values: Dedication, Discipline and Teamwork. Along
with these values, students develop important life skills of leadership
and responsibility. The Band has many opportunities to perform during school
events, and also outside of school during SYF Arts Presentation and other
concerts. Our instructors have extensive teaching and conducting experience
with various organizations, and are very committed to helping the Band
improve. Together, our instructors, students and teachers continually strive
to bring the Band to greater heights.</p>
