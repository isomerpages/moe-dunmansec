### Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunman Concert Band has always been a distinguished CCA in the history of our school. Founded in 1969, it consists of three instrumental families: Brass, Percussion and Woodwind.

The Band strongly believes that every student can learn to play an instrument, can learn to work well with others as a team, and can learn to contribute to the success of the Band. We consistently strive for excellence in all we do, and we operate within an environment of deeply-ingrained values: Dedication, Discipline and Teamwork. Along with these values, students develop important life skills of leadership and responsibility.

The Band has many opportunities to perform during school events, and also outside of school during SYF Arts Presentation and other concerts. Our instructors have extensive teaching and conducting experience with various organizations, and are very committed to helping the Band improve. Together, our instructors, students and teachers continually strive to bring the Band to greater heights.
