<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The choir is directed by the conductor Mr Toh Ban Sheng and supported
by a committed team of teachers. Our Choir made history as the first neighbourhood
school choir to clinch Gold in the demanding Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Choral Competition in 1997. Since then, the Choir continues to attain Gold
at SYF in 1999, 2003, and 2005, the prestigious Gold (with Honours) award
in 2007, 2009 and 2011 at the SYF and the Distinction award at the 2013,
2015, 2017, 2019 and 2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations (SYF
AP). Together with other school choirs, despite the challenges of the worldwide
COVID-19 situation, we also participated in SYF AP 2021, where our choir
members experienced recording our choice piece for the first time.</p>

<p>The inaugural overseas tour to Sydney in 1996 was featured in Straits
Times, a first among the neighbourhood school then.&nbsp; The past overseas
tour to London &amp; Paris (1998), New Zealand (2000), Prague (2003), Czech
Republic-Poland-Austria (2005), Bratislava -Slovakia (2007), Czech Republic-Germany
(2009), Czech Republic-Austria (2010), Czech Republic-Poland-Hungary (2011)
and Czech Republic-Austria-Germany (2013) provided invaluable exposure
to our students.</p>
<p>In the last six overseas tours, the Choir also represented Singapore in
international festivals and received 7 gold awards and 5 special prizes.
At the 14th International Competition Festival of Christmas Music in Prague,
the young team won the Festival Laureate, placed 1st with a Gold in the
Children's category and won&nbsp;2 special awards&nbsp;(Conductor's Prize&nbsp;and
for&nbsp;Dramaturgy). We have also invited world-class maestros to our
school and conduct choral workshops for our choir members.</p>
<p>Members are also given various opportunities to perform for the public.
In 2010, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2023, the Choir was invited by the
Esplanade to put up a full-length concert, under the Limelight series,
at the world-class Esplanade Concert Hall, all of which were very well-received.
The Choir also holds annual combined concerts with choirs from Mayflower
Secondary School, St Joseph’s Institution, Raffles Institution and Catholic
Junior College, the most recent being in April 2024, held at SOTA Concert
Hall. Such concerts provide opportunities for the choir members to hone
their performance skills, gain meaningful learning experiences and exchanges
with other choirs as well.</p>
<p>The choir members are also encouraged to contribute to the school and
society with their talent by performing in various school celebratory events
such as Dunman’s Jubilee and our annual Dunman Appreciation Day. Activities
such as welcome tea, farewell parties and Choir retreats have been organised
to promote bonding among members. Through these activities, members experience
the importance of good leadership and teamwork, as well as the opportunity
to develop into mature individuals.</p>

<p>We believe in character building and leadership training through musical
pursuits.&nbsp;Many of our students have benefited from past activities
and tours and are now assuming leadership roles in various areas within
the school.&nbsp;They have become better people through the discipline
and resilience required in choir and teamwork activities.</p>
<p>We are thankful and blessed for the constant support from the school,
parents and family, as well as the Dunman Choir alumni, without which the
choir would not have achieved all that it has today.</p>
