### Trainings

<p style="text-align: justify;">We aim to provide students with authentic learning experiences which will help them to develop important qualities based on the NPCC values of RISE – Resilience, Integrity, Service and Excellence.
As the COVID situation improves in 2022, the Corps actively participated in many interesting events to engage our cadets and challenge them. On top of drills and campcraft, cadets can expect to immerse in a range of holistic courses such as those relating to Police Knowledge and National Education, and Values-in-Action Programme. </p>

The annual 3-days 2-nights camp Adventure Training Camp (ATC) at Pulau Ubin is one of the highlights for Secondary 2 cadets. With the segmented resumption of camps and face-to-face activities, our Secondary 2 and 3 cadets embarked on an abridged one-day ATC at Pulau Ubin. The cadets were challenged with a 3km hike to the NPCC Campsite and then engaged in a series of activities which include a pioneering competition and field cooking. The cadets had an enriching experience and displayed much perseverance throughout the day.
