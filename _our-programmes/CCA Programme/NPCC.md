<h3>Trainings</h3>
<p>We aim to provide students with authentic learning experiences which will
help them to develop important qualities based on the NPCC values of RISE
– Resilience, Integrity, Service and Excellence. As the COVID situation
improves in 2022, the Corps actively participated in many interesting events
to engage our cadets and challenge them. On top of drills and campcraft,
cadets can expect to immerse in a range of holistic courses such as those
relating to Police Knowledge and National Education, and Values-in-Action

<p>The annual 3-days 2-nights camp Adventure Training Camp (ATC) at Pulau
Ubin is one of the highlights for Secondary 2 cadets. With the segmented
resumption of camps and face-to-face activities, our Secondary 2 and 3
cadets embarked on an abridged one-day ATC at Pulau Ubin. The cadets were
challenged with a 3km hike to the NPCC Campsite and then engaged in a series
of activities which include a pioneering competition and field cooking.
The cadets had an enriching experience and displayed much perseverance
throughout the day.</p>
