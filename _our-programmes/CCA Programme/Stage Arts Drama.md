### Introduction

StageArts Drama train our members to live in the spirit of performance, encompassing the following aims:
* We want to be confident in speaking;&nbsp;
* We want to express ourselves better;&nbsp;
* We want to be able to convince others;
* We want to learn to work well with others;
* We want to learn what makes a good presentation (theatre/ speech);
* We admire and appreciate good performances;
* We are committed and disciplined;
* We always want to do the best for our team.

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe the spirit of performance encompasses life skills that stay with members throughout their lives and allow them to apply these skills in situations within and beyond the school context.</p>

Each StageArts Drama member is known as a Drama StageArtisan.
