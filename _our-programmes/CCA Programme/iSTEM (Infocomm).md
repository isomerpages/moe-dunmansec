In keeping with the fast-moving pace of digital revolution in Singapore and its vision of becoming a Smart Nation, Dunman Infocomm Club strives to enrich the digital literacy of our members through an array of programmes, activities and competitions. These creates opportunities for our members to pursue their interests and deepen their learning in emerging technologies.

**Challenge In Action (Finals)** 

As part of providing exposure to how technology and media are applied in the real world, Infocomm members will also go on learning journeys where they discovered emerging technologies such as Internet-of-Things and Intelligent Robotics and witnessed the use of AR (Augmented Reality)/VR(Virtual Reality) in actual work environments, as well as robots and automation systems.

Through programmes and various platforms throughout each year, our club members will be enriched in their digital literacy. More importantly, they will be equipped with problem-solving skills as they learnt to ‘code’ for life.
