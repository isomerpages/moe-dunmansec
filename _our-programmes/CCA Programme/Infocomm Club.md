# Infocomm Club

### Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dunman Infocomm Club strives to enrich the IT skills of its members through a progression of trainings, courses and competitions. The club focuses on two areas to develop the IT skills of its members, namely Robotics (programming with physical) and Coding (programming).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The club has a dedicated Robotics Room which houses our lower secondary members. Members are introduced to basic-intermediate Robotics with block-based programming which allows them to experience both the physical building of LEGO Mindstorm EV3 Robotics systems as well as the mentally challenging Robotics programming to overcome obstacles and perform specific tasks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This year, Secondary 1 and selected Secondary 2 members are introduce to Swift Coding Programming, using their iPads to learn on this programming for App Development. They are part of the inaugural Swift Coding Club, which will continue next year to go deeper in learning Swift Coding.</p>
