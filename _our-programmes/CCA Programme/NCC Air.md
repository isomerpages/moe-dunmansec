### Introduction
 
Established in 1999, Dunman NCC Air aims to instill in our cadets pride, honor and mutual respect.  We aim to do our best in all our endeavors, be it in competitions or involving our cadets in enriching activities.

### Achievements

In 2022, we received our 20th consecutive Distinction Award for our performance in 2021 in the Unit Recognition (UR) award. We thank our cadets for their dedication and perseverance in training, and the parents and teachers of our cadets for their continuous support and dedication to the unit.

### Trainings

NCC Air offers a variety of activities, such as hands-on training at the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) fighter and helicopter simulator centres, military plane joyrides, SAR-21 shooting, aeromodelling courses, and fighter squadron visits. In addition, there are also camps such as Camp Forge, Camp Steel and Senior Specialist Leaders’ Camp. The list goes on.

Our cadets also get the opportunities to enhance their knowledge on Total Defence through various activities such as the Total Defence Strategy Card Game and Total Defence presentations.

Aeromodelling workshops such as Balsa wood plane-making and drone workshops enable our cadets to learn the mechanics of flight and flying skills, daring them to push beyond their comfort zones to acquire knowledge which will prepare them well for the future.

In the freestyle drill competition, our cadets’ creativity in choreographing their drill routine and determination during training enabled them to achieve top 10 placing in the finals.

These numerous activities act as a platform through which our cadets are exposed to the various aspects of the RSAF and the military, in the hope that some will be inspired to reach for the skies to serve as pilots in the RSAF. These activities also enable our cadets to grow into well-rounded leaders who can dutifully carry out the responsibilities entrusted to them.

As a uniformed group, drills form an integral part of our training. This is where respect, discipline, perseverance and sheer grit are inculcated into our cadets. In this aspect, we are proud to share that our cadets are well-trained and play an important part in various school parades.

Our training is however not limited to the “AIR” syllabus. Our cadets play different sports during training and take part in competitions such as soccer where they achieved third position in the district finals. In doing so, our cadets learn the values of sportsmanship and teamwork, while building camaraderie between themselves and with cadets from other schools.

We look forward to the future, and we will continue to seek new avenues to enrich the NCC Air experience of our cadets to develop the next generation of future leaders.
