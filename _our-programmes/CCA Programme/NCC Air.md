<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Established in 1999, Dunman NCC Air aims to instill in our cadets pride,
honor and mutual respect. We aim to do our best in all our endeavors, be
it in competitions or involving our cadets in enriching activities.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>IIn 2023, we received our 21st consecutive Distinction Award for our performance
in 2022 in the Unit Recognition (UR) award. We thank our cadets for their
dedication and perseverance in training, and the parents and teachers of
our cadets for their continuous support and dedication to the unit.</p>

<h3>Trainings</h3>
<p>NCC Air offers a variety of activities, such as hands-on training at the
Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) fighter and helicopter simulator
centres, military plane joyrides, SAR-21 shooting, aeromodelling courses,
and fighter squadron visits. In addition, there are also camps such as
Camp Forge, Camp Steel and Senior Specialist Leaders’ Camp. The list goes
on.</p>
<p>Our cadets also get the opportunities to enhance their knowledge on Total
Defence through various activities such as the Total Defence Strategy Card
Game and Total Defence presentations.</p>
<p>Aeromodelling workshops such as Balsa wood plane-making and drone workshops
enable our cadets to learn the mechanics of flight and flying skills, daring
them to push beyond their comfort zones to acquire knowledge which will
prepare them well for the future. We are proud to share that our drone
swarming team performed Dunman’s inaugural drone swarming dance during
our National Day 2023 concert.</p>

<p>In the precision drill competition, our cadets’ creativity in choreographing
their drill routine and determination during training enabled them to achieve
fourth in Singapore and second in the Air District finals.</p>

<p>These numerous activities act as a platform through which our cadets are
exposed to the various aspects of the RSAF and the military, in the hope
that some will be inspired to reach for the skies to serve as pilots in
the RSAF. These activities also enable our cadets to grow into well-rounded
leaders who can dutifully carry out the responsibilities entrusted to them.</p>
<p>As a uniformed group, drills form an integral part of our training. This
is where respect, discipline, perseverance and sheer grit are inculcated
into our cadets. In this aspect, we are proud to share that our cadets
are well-trained and play an important part in various school parades.</p>

<p>Our training is however not limited to the “AIR” syllabus. Our cadets
play different sports during training and take part in competitions such
as football where they placed second in the Air District finals. In doing
so, our cadets learn the values of sportsmanship and teamwork, while building
camaraderie between themselves and with cadets from other schools.</p>

to enrich the NCC Air experience of our cadets to develop the next generation
of future leaders.</p>
