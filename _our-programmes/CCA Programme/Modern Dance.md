### Introduction

**Dunman Dancers' Core Values: Discipline; Responsibility; Respect; Humility**

Started out as an Interest Group in 2013 with only 7 dancers and 1 teacher, the journey of Dunman Modern Dance CCA is an inspiring story to passionate Dunmanites in keeping the faith and passion for dance. With no professional background and instructors' guidance in 2013, the dancers believed in trying their best in coming together to choreograph their own dance moves to perform at school celebrations and subsequently perform at the Dunman 50th Jubilee platform which marks their debut as a united One Dunman Dance Team.
  
Dunman Modern Dance CCA became a full-fledged Second CCA in 2014 and forged a breakthrough in 2015 with 45 passionate dancers in our very first participation in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF-International Dance) and Super 24 2015, achieving our very first Certificate of Distinction and Super 24 top ten finalists team respectively.  We were then granted the First CCA in 2016. With the determination of the Dunman Dancers and teachers, Infini Sonar continued to work hard and break barriers with our outstanding achievements in SYF (International Dance) 2017 and 2019 (Certificate of Distinction) as well as Super 24 Finals Competitions from 2015 to 2018. The Modern Dance CCA further celebrated our CCA’s 5th Anniversary at the Dunman HUES Concert 2018 with the splendid performances brought together by the Dunman Dancers and the Dance Alumni - Infini Invictus. The CCA also forged a breakthrough with the expansion of the CCA up to 60 dancers starting 2018 and attaining the first ever Top 5 placings at Super 24 Competition 2018.

Moving into Infini Sonar’s 10th year Anniversary Milestone of the CCA establishment, the Dunman Dancers continue to build resilience as we tide through the pandemic wave and emerged stronger and more united with our first ever achievement of double Certificate of Distinction at the SYF (International Dance) Arts Presentation 2021 and obtaining the “Best Dance Crew” Award and “5-Stars” Achievement at the 2022 PAssionArts Open Stage Dance Competition.

We, at Dunman Modern Dance CCA believe the spirit of Dunman Dancers will carry on shining and inspire more prospective dancers to join us in the future!
