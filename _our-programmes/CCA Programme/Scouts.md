<p>Established since 1964, we aim to develop our scouts to be resilient and
all-rounded leaders who are responsible and readily contribute back to
our society. Our Dunman Dove scouts uphold&nbsp;Scout Promise and Law and&nbsp;always
strive to do their best in all kind of situations.</p>
<p>Our scouts are provided with various opportunities to acquire skills and
knowledge through badge courses including Civil Defence badge, Air-Model
Maker Badge, Young Mariner’s Badge. Our scouts are exposed to many outdoor
activities such as navigation, hiking, dragon boating, sports climbing
and kayaking.</p>

<p>The patrol system is a good platform for scouts to hone their leadership.&nbsp;
We inculcate discipline, determination, teamwork and leadership qualities
through scout trainings and camps. Scouts are equipped with life skills
such as cooking, Backwoodsman cooking and campcraft. Besides forging camaraderie
among scouts, they have become more resilient in face&nbsp;of challenges
in life.</p>

and 11th Taiwan National Scout Jamboree (2018).</p>
