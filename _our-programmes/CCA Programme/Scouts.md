### Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">Established since 1964, we aim to develop our scouts to be resilient and all-rounded leaders who are responsible and readily contribute back to our society. Our Dunman Dove scouts uphold Scout Promise and Law and always strive to do their best in all kind of situations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our scouts are provided with various opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge through badge courses including Civil Defence badge, Air-Model Maker Badge, Young Mariner’s Badge. Our scouts are exposed to many outdoor activities such as navigation, hiking, dragon boating, sports climbing and kayaking.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The patrol system is a good platform for scouts to hone their leadership.  We inculcate discipline, determination, teamwork and leadership qualities through scout trainings and camps. Scouts are equipped with life skills such as cooking, Backwoodsman cooking and campcraft. Besides forging camaraderie among scouts, they have become more resilient in face of challenges in life.</p>
