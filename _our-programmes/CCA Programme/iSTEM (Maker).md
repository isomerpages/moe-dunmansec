<p>Our CCA had the privilege of hosting a group of students and teachers
from Vietnam for an educational exchange. As part of the visit, our members
facilitated a workshop on hydroponics using our school's vertical farming
system.</p>
<p>During the workshop, we introduced the fundamentals of hydroponic farming,
highlighting its advantages and applications in sustainable agriculture.
Our members demonstrated how to set up and maintain a hydroponic system,
explaining the role of water, nutrients, and light in plant growth. The
visitors also had hands-on experience planting seedlings and observing
the functioning of our vertical farming setup.</p>
<p>This collaboration provided a unique opportunity for cross-cultural learning,
allowing our members to share their knowledge and skills while learning
about agricultural practices in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Our CCA recently participated in the Science Fair organized by A*STAR
and Victoria Junior College (VJC). Three of our teams showcased their innovative
projects, which highlighted creativity, scientific inquiry, and teamwork.</p>
<p>We are proud to share that one of our teams achieved a Silver Award, a
testament to their dedication and hard work. The experience provided all
participants with valuable insights into scientific research and the opportunity
to learn from other talented teams.</p>
<p>This accomplishment reflects our CCA’s commitment to fostering a passion
for STEM and cultivating excellence among our members.</p>
