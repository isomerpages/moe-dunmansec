### Introduction
![](/images/CCA%20Photos/Badminton/2020%20Web%20Page%20Photo%201.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our CCA’s goal is to develop disciplined and daring athletes, imbued with a strong sense of duty to the team. They play their competitions with a tenacious determination for winning and clear discernment in fair play and sportsmanship. They will be gracious in victory and undaunted in defeat.</p>

### Achievements 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the B &amp; C Division Boys took part in the East Zone Inter-school Badminton Championships. They are frequent contestants in the second rounds of the zonal games. They also participated in external competitions such as the Wee Kim Wee Badminton Tournament. One of our teams had advanced to the quarter-finals of this fiercely contested tournament, in which over 30 teams from the top schools in Singapore had entered.
	
2013: B Division East Zone Top Four
2016: C Division East Zone Top Eight
2017: B Division East Zone Top Eight
2022: C Division East Zone Top Eight
2022: St Patrick’s School Invitational Cup Champion. 


### Trainings

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We train on every Tuesday and Thursday. Nearing our competitions, we have an additional training on Fridays.
	
To prepare our players for their competitions, we also arrange frequent friendly matches with other schools. Other than the strenuous weekly physical training, friendly matches had helped to instill mental toughness and self-confidence in our players.
