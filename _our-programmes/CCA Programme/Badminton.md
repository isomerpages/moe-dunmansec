 # Training

Our training sessions take place every Tuesday and Friday, with an additional session on Fridays as competitions approach. To sharpen our players’ skills and mental toughness, we organise regular friendly matches with other schools. In addition to our demanding weekly physical training, these matches play a crucial role in building self-confidence and preparing our players for the intensity of competitive play.
