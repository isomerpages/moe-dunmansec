<h1>Training</h1>
<p>Our training sessions take place 2 to 3 times every week on Tuesday, Thursday
and Friday. To sharpen our players’ skills and mental toughness, we organise
regular friendly matches with other schools. In addition to our demanding
weekly physical training, these matches play a crucial role in building
self-confidence and preparing our players for the intensity of competitive
play.</p>
