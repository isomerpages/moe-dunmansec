### Introduction

![](/images/Student%20Development%20Programme/CCA%20Programme/Sports%20&%20Games/Picture1.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunman's Volleyball CCA provides a vibrant and enriching experience for our student athletes. We value competitive sports for the lessons they teach about leadership teamwork, victory and defeat. Besides just volleyball skills and knowledge, we constantly seek to provide the students in the program with a supportive and engaging environment to develop academically, socially and emotionally too.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our training program is structured with technical skills training with a strong focus on inculcating character building values. </p>

  
This includes:

*   Emphasis on skills development
*   Meticulous tactical training
*   Customised physical conditioning
*   Individual academic support
*   Integration of Social-Emotional Learning through Sportsmanship and Leadership

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our volleyball players are also provided vast opportunities to compete in friendly matches leading up to the National School tournaments. We also work closely with post-secondary institutions, Junior Colleges (Nanyang JC), and Polytechnics for Direct School Admission (DSA).</p>

<b><u>Our Coaches</u></b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Shen Ke Qin, an <b>ex-National Team player for China & Singapore</b>. Mr Shen brings with him a wealth of experience from his time as a national team player & coach from <b>1981 to 1993</b>. Over the years, he has continually adapted and refined his coaching approach to engage the student athletes. At the same time, he places <b>strong emphasis on the character development</b> of the athletes in the program. Mr Shen has consistently guided our ‘B’ Division teams to greater heights, cementing our position as a major contender in the volleyball arena.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mdm Chen Yi Yi, an <b>ex-Shanghai State Team player from 1981 to 1985</b>. With her specialised coaching for <b>developing strong foundational skills</b>, she has since led our ‘C’ Division girls to 6 East Zone and 1 National titles, after making our maiden appearance in the Girls competition in 2008.</p>

### Achievements
