<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Dunman Secondary School’s Green Club has been serving the school for many
years and will continue its mission to empower our students to promote
environmental awareness within and beyond the school community through
trainings and involvement in community projects and events.</p>
<p>Our members serve as green ambassadors not just for the students and staff
of the school but also for the community. They strive to bring the school
and community closer together. The club has started many initiatives to
help to reduce the amount of food waste generated by the school. It started
collecting some of this food waste and converting them into compost. Over
and above that, we have started an eco-pond which provides an excellent
opportunity for students to learn about nutrient recycling. The waste water
from the pond is also used to water the plants and hence reducing water
wastage.</p>
<p>The club also embraces and celebrates the school’s past achievements.
Dunman Secondary School was one of the first Integrated Schools in Singapore,
and it was the first with triple integration. To showcase this milestone,
the club has designated a multi-racial garden where herbs and spices commonly
used by the three majority ethnic groups of Singaporeans are planted and
showcased. Some of these plants include chili, chives and ginger. To honour
Singapore’s first police commissioner whom the school was named after,
the club has also dedicated a portion of the garden as an English garden
where English herbs and flowers are grown.</p>

<p>The club realises that it is integral to include the community to help
to spread the message of the importance of conservation. Hence, the club
regularly engages its partners in helping to spread these messages. In
2019, the club members taught the children at My First Skool kindergarten
the importance of recycling and how to make a self-watering flowerpots
using recycled materials. In 2018, the club also went to the All Saints
Home to help cheer and teach the elderly how to fold paper flowers using
recycled paper. These activities are in line with the club’s mission of
forming valuable partnerships to create a green and sustainable environment
in Dunman and the community.</p>

<p>Members of Green club, will be able to learn many new skills. In addition
to learning horticulture skills such as plant propagation and care, they
will be allowed to choose the enrichment activities that they can partake.
Some of these activities include paper origami, flower pressing and making
a table lamp using recycled materials, just to name a few. All these experiences
ensure that the students are learning beyond the classroom and at the same
time, learning how to make Singapore a greener place.</p>

the school in many competitions such as the Sembcorp Greenwave Competition.
