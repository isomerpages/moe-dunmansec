<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In 2024, Dunman Secondary School’s Green Club embarked on a journey filled
with meaningful activities and impactful initiatives, staying true to our
mission of being green ambassadors for the community. From fostering a
love for nature to engaging in community outreach, our members embraced
every opportunity to make a difference.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>As part of the iSTEM Academy, we introduced all Secondary 1 students to
the art of nature journalling. Through this program, students learned to
observe the wonders of the natural world while connecting these observations
to Dunman’s 5 ‘D’ values, such as Discipline and Determination. This hands-on
experience fostered a deeper appreciation for the environment and an understanding
of the values we stand for.</p>
<p>Our club members also rolled up their sleeves to revamp our school’s garden,
adding vibrant new plants that will serve as a foundation for even more
exciting projects in 2025. This hands-on gardening project not only beautified
the space but also provided a tangible way for members to express their
dedication to environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Our annual Leaders' Retreat took us on an unforgettable adventure to Gardens
by the Bay, where both current EXCO members and potential leaders explored
the TreeTop Walk and the OCBC Skyway. Surrounded by lush greenery and breathtaking
views, our leaders engaged in discussions on the challenges and future
directions for our CCA, creating a bond that will guide us forward.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 Green Club members took center stage at the Science Buskers
Festival, organized by the Science Centre. Dressed in vibrant costumes,
they performed an engaging three-minute skit to teach audiences about the
incredible world of plants, leaving an impression on all who watched!</p>

<p>In our quest for sustainability knowledge, we attended the “Sustainability
in Motion” workshop at RWS’s SEA Aquarium. Members gained insights into
the aquarium’s sustainability efforts, such as jellyfish breeding initiatives,
and even witnessed exclusive behind-the-scenes activities, like divers
feeding the wildlife. It was an eye-opening experience that left a lasting
impact on everyone involved.</p>

<p>Our passion for community service shone through in our partnership with
Hao Ren Hao Shi and NE CDC for Project Refresh. Green Club members and
staff joined forces to distribute food essentials to residents in Tampines.
With a mobile food truck and plenty of smiles, we offered support and learned
valuable lessons on empathy and gratitude, reinforcing our commitment to
be a blessing to others.</p>
<p>Reflecting on a year filled with purpose, the Green Club looks forward
to 2025 with excitement and anticipation. With the upcoming Community in
Bloom competition and more sustainability initiatives in the works, we
are ready to continue making a positive impact, both in our school and
beyond!</p>
