### Introduction


<p style="text-align: justify;">If you thrive on teamwork, speed, and challenge, netball is the perfect game for you! Under the expert guidance of our coach, Ms. Vivian De Silva, you’ll gain invaluable experience while mastering key techniques and strategies.

Our netballers also have the opportunity to build camaraderie at our bonding camp, where newcomers and teachers connect and form lasting friendships. We focus on holistic development, ensuring that our players not only enhance their skills but also grow in values and competencies.

With numerous chances to compete in friendly matches and the National School tournaments, our netballers strive to reach new heights. Join us and become a part of Dunman’s netball legacy!</p><p>

#### Achievements
</p><p>
In the National School Games 2024, our netballers demonstrated unwavering commitment and resilience. Each match was an opportunity to showcase their skills, hard work, and the spirit of Dunman. They met each challenge head-on with a positive attitude, playing each game with pride and leaving a lasting impression on all who watched. This has resulted in the B Division players emerging as champions for the East Zone Netball Competition and C Division as 1st runner up in the National School Games.
