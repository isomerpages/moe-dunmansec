# Red Cross

### Introduction

![](/images/Student%20Development%20Programme/CCA%20Programme/Uniformed%20Groups/red_cross.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunman Red Cross Youth (RCY) is part of Singapore Red Cross Society. It is a unique uniformed-group made up by discerning individuals who have chosen to make their secondary school life purposeful by engaging the community through first-aid related services.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">With “Serving Humanity, Saving Lives” as the RCY motto, we aim to develop our cadets as servant leaders by serving the community with the skills that they acquire through the Red Cross activities. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We aspire for our Red Cross cadets to be an ethical change maker. Rooted in sound values, they will learn to make discerning decisions, be discipline in everything they do and discharge their duties with the spirit of excellence. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To develop our cadets holistically, besides First Aid and Disaster Management skills, cadets will get to experience outdoor orienteering, team-building games, be ambassadors of the Blood Donation programme, foot-drill sessions, HQ and internal camps, International Youth Exchange Programme, etc. They will also be given opportunities to initiate and serve in local and overseas Values-In-Action (VIA) activities.</p>

### Achievements

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2020, the Red Cross Youth in Dunman Secondary School was awarded Gold for the Excellent Unit Award (EUA).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2021, our team of Secondary Three cadets competed in the Disaster Risk Reduction Competition, where they conducted a learning activity online to educate others on the prevention of Dengue Fever. Our team obtained the Gold Award.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2021, two Secondary Three cadets also competed individually in the Ambassadors of Blood Competition, where they showcased their oratorical skills through video submissions of how they would encourage their peers to donate blood and save lives. They obtained the Commendation Award.</p>
