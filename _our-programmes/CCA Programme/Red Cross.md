<p>The Dunman Red Cross Youth (RCY) is an integral component of the Singapore
Red Cross Society. This distinguished uniformed group comprises individuals
who have chosen to enrich their secondary school experience by actively
participating in the community through various first-aid services.</p>
<p>With "Serving Humanity, Saving Lives" as the guiding motto of RCY, our
primary goal is to mold our cadets into servant leaders who contribute
to the community by applying the skills they acquire through Red Cross
activities. Our vision for Red Cross cadets is to nurture them into ethical
change-makers deeply rooted in strong values. They will learn to make thoughtful
decisions, maintain discipline in all their endeavors, and execute their
responsibilities with unwavering dedication to excellence.</p>
<p>To ensure the comprehensive development of our cadets, beyond imparting
First Aid and Disaster Management skills, we provide them with opportunities
to engage in outdoor orienteering, team-building activities, promotion
of the Blood Donation program, rigorous foot-drill sessions, headquarters
and internal camps, participation in the International Youth Exchange Programme,
and more. Additionally, they will have the chance to initiate and partake
in both local and international Values-In-Action (VIA) activities.</p>
