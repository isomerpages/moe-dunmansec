### Mission / Objectives of Department
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our department is committed to providing positive and meaningful experiences in mathematics for our students. Our mission is to develop students into problem solvers, equipped with the ability to apply mathematical concepts in real-world contexts.
</p>

### Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Mathematics Department comprises of four subjects: Mathematics, Additional Mathematics, Elements of Business Skills and Principles of Accounts.Our students are exposed to a wide range of learning experiences, both inside and outside of the classroom, offline and online. Through an Inquiry-Based Learning approach, infused with key skills in Design Thinking, these learning experiences help to build strong foundation and competencies in each subject, as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Leveraging on technology, our exploratory activities are designed to trigger students’ curiosity, discover joy of learning, guide students in making connections and apply their learning in authentic real-world contexts. We believe that this approach engages our learners, as well as fosters a deeper understanding and their appreciation of mathematics.

We understand that each student has their own unique learning style, and our teachers are trained to cater to these differences through Differentiated Instruction. We believe that every student can excel in mathematics, and we strive to provide the necessary support to help them achieve their potential.Committed to our mission, besides checking for students’ understanding through summative assessments and providing formative feedback, our students also have opportunities to demonstrate their conceptual understanding and develop 21st Century Competencies such as higher order thinking skills, problem solving abilities and communication skills through Alternative Assessments which we have embarked on since 2016.

### Programmes and Activities
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In 2023, collaborating with STEM IPW (Integrated Project Work) and leveraging on digital tools, through STEMxWellbeing Alternative Assessment, our lower secondary students learn how to collect, summarise and interpret their own authentic statistical data related to Sleep, Think, Eat, Move (<i>STEM<sup>2</sup></i>) habits. Through analysing their data and Design Thinking, students will then make data-driven decisions on which areas of <i>STEM<sup>2</sup></i> to focus on for their STEM IPW projects in improving their health and wellbeing.</p>
	
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students also participate in the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, organized by the Singapore Mathematical Society and have achieved many awards. In 2022, our students clinched 3 Honorary Mentions and 1 Bronze Award. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Other in-house programmes and activities such as Kite-Flying (Sec 1 NA/ NT), Mathematics Trail (Sec 2) and Rube Goldberg Challenge (Sec 3), provide our students with valuable opportunities to apply their learning beyond the classrooms, make connections with other subjects and see the world with new perspectives through their mathematical lens.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Mathematics Department strives towards pedagogical excellence and we look forward to working with our students to develop them into Resilient Problem Solvers, Self-Directed Learners and Critical Thinkers.</p>
