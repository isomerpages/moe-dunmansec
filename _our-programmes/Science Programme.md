### Mission/ Objectives of Department
<p style="text-align: justify;">The department strives to establish a repertoire of innovative teaching pedagogies and learning practices in Science by Educators and encourage a spirit of discovery and an attitude of excellence in the learning of Science for Student Learners.</p>

### Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment (CPA)
<p style="text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;<b><i>ESTALA</i></b>, an overarching Department framework, guides the teachers in the designing and crafting of lesson packages and enrichment program to provide an authentic learning experience as well as encourage higher thinking order among the students. During this process, inquisitive mind and intrinsic motivation will be activated among our students to bring about the Joy of Learning.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the enactment of this framework, students are exposed to the Practices of Science. Students become more aware that Science is not just a body of facts but also a cumulative learning experiences which can be affected by Social, Economic, Technology and Environmental factors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The department provides different courses in Science ranging from Pure Sciences to Combined Sciences to cater to the different needs and proficiency level of our students. The Scientific Literacy of our students are strengthen through the 8 Elements of Scientific Thoughts which are introduced progressively over a span of 4 to 5 years of educations in Dunman Secondary.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Knowledge is not just constructed from direct instructions from our teachers but are also co-constructed among the students. As such, Active Learning strategies are used to bring about constructivist learning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our department also believes in providing varied mode of assessments ranging from projects to practical and written papers are used to provide a holistic assessment of our students. Formative assessment in the form of quizzes, online games, model making are also deployed to provide constant feedbacks to our students to inform them of where they are, where they should be and how to move forward.</p>

### Programmes and Activities
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our STEM Talent Development Programme aims to create a positive STEM immersion experience for our students, through the following programmes:</p>
  
#### STEM-infused Science Curriculum (SiSc)
<p style="text-align: justify;">STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It is important for our students to be exposed to STEM as “…scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. To succeed in this new information-based and highly technological society, students need to develop their capabilities in STEM to level much beyond what was consider acceptable in the past” (National Science Foundation, 2007)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are currently developing our four-year STEM-infused Science curriculum. By infusing STEM in our science curriculum, it provides a platform for students to acquire the fundamental ideas essential for the understanding of Science and thereby building a strong science fundamental. In addition, it also allows the students to see the connectivity across various subject disciplines and hopefully to pursue STEM for future learning and work.</p>
