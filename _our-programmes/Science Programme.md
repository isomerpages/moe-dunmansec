<h3>Mission/ Objectives of Department</h3>
<p>The department strives to establish a repertoire of innovative teaching
pedagogies and learning practices in Science by Educators and encourage
a spirit of discovery and an attitude of excellence in the learning of
Science for Student Learners.</p>
<h3>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment (CPA)</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><em>ESTALA</em></strong>, an overarching Department framework,
guides the teachers in the designing and crafting of lesson packages and
enrichment program to provide an authentic learning experience as well
as encourage higher thinking order among the students. During this process,
inquisitive mind and intrinsic motivation will be activated among our students
to bring about the Joy of Learning.</p>
<p>During the enactment of this framework, students are exposed to the Practices
of Science. Students become more aware that Science is not just a body
of facts but also a cumulative learning experiences which can be affected
by Social, Economic, Technology and Environmental factors.</p>

<p>The department provides different courses in Science ranging from Pure
Sciences to Combined Sciences to cater to the different needs and proficiency
level of our students. The Scientific Literacy of our students are strengthen
through the 8 Elements of Scientific Thoughts which are introduced progressively
over a span of 4 to 5 years of educations in Dunman Secondary.</p>
<p>Knowledge is not just constructed from direct instructions from our teachers
but are also co-constructed among the students. As such, Active Learning
strategies are used to bring about constructivist learning.</p>
<p>Our department also believes in providing varied mode of assessments ranging
from projects to practical and written papers are used to provide a holistic
assessment of our students. Formative assessment in the form of quizzes,
online games, model making are also deployed to provide constant feedbacks
to our students to inform them of where they are, where they should be
and how to move forward.</p>
<h3>Programmes and Activities</h3>
<p>Our STEM Talent Development Programme aims to create a positive STEM immersion
experience for our students, through the following programmes:</p>
<h4>STEM-infused Science Curriculum (SiSc)</h4>
<p>STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It is
important for our students to be exposed to STEM as “…scientific and technological
innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits
and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. To
succeed in this new information-based and highly technological society,
students need to develop their capabilities in STEM to level much beyond
what was consider acceptable in the past” (National Science Foundation,
2007)</p>
<p>By infusing STEM in our science curriculum, it provides a platform for
students to acquire the fundamental ideas essential for the understanding
of Science. It also allows the students to see the connectivity across
various subject disciplines and hopefully to pursue STEM for future learning
and work. Our student work has been featured at multiple platforms.</p>
