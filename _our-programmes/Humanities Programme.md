<h3>Mission / Objectives of Department</h3>
<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<p>A discerning Dunmanite who appreciates the environment, keeps up-to-date
with current issues, and possesses the ability to link the past, present
and future.</p>
<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>The Humanities Department is determined to provide students with a holistic
and vigorous learning experience to help our students see the world through
multiple lenses. We seek to equip our students with critical thinking and
communication skills as well as encourage them to develop a global perspective
so that they can become confident persons who are able to navigate the
complexities of a rapidly changing world, active contributors and concerned
citizens.</p>
<h3>Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment (CPA)</h3>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The History Team in Dunman Secondary school seeks to develop a student
who is a self-directed, active and concerned citizen. Our goal is for our
students to be informed, discerning in judgement, asks questions and reflects
on their process of learning. At the heart of history education lies the
quest to uncover the complexities that define the human experience. This
is especially valuable in a world where attention is often divided between
concerns over the present and the future. Learning to manage the present
and anticipate the future would not be possible without looking back at
the past. Learning history helps students draw connections between the
nature and impact of past developments, and how they affect the present
world we live in.</p>
<h4>Geography</h4>
<p>With the adoption of an issues-based approach that focuses on contemporary
geographical issues, the syllabus provides students with an opportunity
to explore geographical questions. The Geography Team at Dunman Secondary
School utilizes the pedagogy of inquiry to expose students to geographical
data from a variety of sources. They learn how to do so in a responsible
and critical manner, which also helps them develop communication, collaboration
and information skills effectively. This way, students gain a global awareness
of current geographical issues and challenges, and develop a concern and
appreciation for the environment around them.</p>
<h4>Social Studies</h4>
<p>The Social Studies Team at Dunman Secondary School seeks to prepare students
to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness
of Singapore and the bigger world they live in, and appreciate complexities
of the human experience. We try our best to create authentic learning experiences
for our students through a range of different pedagogies that pique their
interest in important societal issues. We hope that our students become
informed, concerned and participative citizens that care about contributing
responsibly to the society and world they live in.</p>
<h3>Programmes and Activities</h3>
<h4>Inquiry-Based Learning</h4>
<p><strong>1. Geographical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>Dunman’s Geographical Investigation (GI) provides students with the opportunities
to appreciate real-world application of geographical knowledge and help
them acquire 21st Century Competencies. From Secondary 1 to Secondary 3,
Geography students carry out inquiry-based learning on various issues.</p>

<p>The Secondary One cohort at Dunman Secondary School embarked on a comprehensive
geographical investigation focused on assessing water quality within their
school environment. This project aimed to emphasise the critical role of
water in sustaining life and its broader impact on both human communities
and natural ecosystems. Equipped with water quality test kits, students
worked in small groups to evaluate key indicators such as pH levels and
dissolved oxygen in the school's pond, enhancing their understanding of
how water quality influences the well-being of living organisms. Through
hands-on data collection, teamwork, and discussions, students linked textbook
knowledge to real-world applications, reinforcing their learning through
experiential engagement.</p>

</div>
<p>Building on this investigative approach, Secondary Two students participated
in an interdisciplinary project exploring the inquiry question: “How do
human activities affect the environmental sustainability of Tampines Eco-Green?”
For the first time, students integrated knowledge from both Geography and
Science to deepen their understanding of ecosystems and tropical forests.
Guided by their teachers, they developed essential skills in data collection,
analysis, and fieldwork techniques before applying them in the field. Despite
the challenges of the afternoon heat, students enthusiastically conducted
investigations, documented their observations through sketches, and proposed
strategies for improving environmental sustainability. These projects exemplified
Dunman Secondary School’s commitment to hands-on learning, fostering critical
thinking and collaboration while strengthening students’ connection to
their environment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Historical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>To ignite students’ curiosity about history and equip them with a critical
historical perspective, we have designed Historical Investigation (HI)
to bring classroom learning to life. Through learning journeys to the National
Museum of Singapore, students engage with historical sources and apply
key historical concepts in a meaningful way.</p>

<p><strong>Sensory Skills Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>TThe members of the Sensory Skills Programme have increased in strength
to 40 since its inception in 2019. The lower secondary students continue
to actively monitor the environment along the 2 transects around Dunman
Secondary School in conjunction with the NSS-ESN Programme. They have observed
25 different bird species such as the Green Imperial Pigeon and Long-tailed
Shrike. The secondary two students continue to nature journal their observations
and are also doing research on other bird species found in different environments
other than Dunman Secondary School.</p>

</div>
<p>There are two main achievements so far by the students in the programme.
Firstly, two teams from the secondary 1 and 2 level achieved the top two
positions of the ‘Highest Biodiversity Observed’ during the 2nd Biodiversity
Race on 30th May 2023. The two teams raced with thirty other groups from
other schools and managed to identify more than 30 different species of
amphibians, birds, butterflies, and reptiles.</p>
<p>Secondly, the secondary 3 students updated their online game called ‘Avian
Watch’ with local mascots like the pangolin, oriental pied hornbill and
smooth coated otters that the students created themselves. They were invited
by My First Skool @ Segar Road to share the game with the pre-schoolers
and their parents during their Bird Race on the 8th of July 2023. They
have been invited by Nature Society Singapore to share their partnership
with My First Skool on the 2nd NSS-ESN Symposium in November.</p>
<p>The students will continue to work on their nature journals and inspire
their peers within and beyond school to learn more about the biodiversity
of their urban environment. Hopefully they will become environmental advocates
of the future.</p>

<p>This is an example of a reflection done by Hong Dehui of Secondary 3E
on the NSS-ESN Programme .</p>
<p><strong>Comments by students :</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I felt that there is a variety of biodiversity in Singapore such as birds
like Javan Myna, Spotted Doves, that could be noticed if we pay close attention
to it. There are also some birds who we may not have noticed normally but
they still are a part of the biodiversity which is also a part of learning
such as their habitats and diet which allow me to understand the biodiversity
of Singapore. My experience has been great from participating in the NSS-ESN
programme so far and I thought it is beneficial as we could understand
the bird species more and improve on our observational skills which helps
us to identify the birds easier and faster.
