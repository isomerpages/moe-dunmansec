### Mission / Objectives of Department
#### Our Vision
<p style="text-align: justify;">A discerning Dunmanite who appreciates the environment, keeps up-to-date with current issues, and possesses the ability to link the past, present and future.</p>

#### Our Mission
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Humanities Department is determined to provide students with a holistic and vigorous learning experience to help our students see the world through multiple lenses. We seek to equip our students with critical thinking and communication skills as well as encourage them to develop a global perspective so that they can become confident persons who are able to navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing world, active contributors and concerned citizens.</p>

### Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment (CPA)
#### History
<p style="text-align: justify;">The History Team in Dunman Secondary school seeks to develop a student who is a self-directed, active and concerned citizen. Our goal is for our students to be informed, discerning in judgement, asks questions and reflects on their process of learning. At the heart of history education lies the quest to uncover the complexities that define the human experience. This is especially valuable in a world where attention is often divided between concerns over the present and the future. Learning to manage the present and anticipate the future would not be possible without looking back at the past. Learning history helps students draw connections between the nature and impact of past developments, and how they affect the present world we live in.</p>

#### Geography
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the adoption of an issues-based approach that focuses on contemporary geographical issues, the syllabus provides students with an opportunity to explore geographical questions. The Geography Team at Dunman Secondary School utilizes the pedagogy of inquiry to expose students to geographical data from a variety of sources. They learn how to do so in a responsible and critical manner, which also helps them develop communication, collaboration and information skills effectively. This way, students gain a global awareness of current geographical issues and challenges, and develop a concern and appreciation for the environment around them.</p>

#### Social Studies
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Social Studies Team at Dunman Secondary School seeks to prepare students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the bigger world they live in, and appreciate complexities of the human experience. We try our best to create authentic learning experiences for our students through a range of different pedagogies that pique their interest in important societal issues. We hope that our students become informed, concerned and participative citizens that care about contributing responsibly to the society and world they live in.</p>

### Programmes and Activities
#### Inquiry-Based Learning

**1\. Geographical Investigation**
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunman’s Geographical Investigation (GI) provides students with the opportunities to appreciate real-world application of geographical knowledge and help them acquire 21st Century Competencies. From Secondary 1 to Secondary 3, Geography students carry out inquiry-based learning on various issues.</p>

**GI Highlights**
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Secondary One cohort at Dunman Secondary School embarked on a comprehensive geographical investigation focused on assessing water quality within their school environment. This project aimed to emphasise the critical role of water in sustaining life and its broader impact on both human communities and natural ecosystems. Equipped with water quality test kits, students worked in small groups to evaluate key indicators such as pH levels and dissolved oxygen in the school's pond, enhancing their understanding of how water quality influences the well-being of living organisms. Through hands-on data collection, teamwork, and discussions, students linked textbook knowledge to real-world applications, reinforcing their learning through experiential engagement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Building on this investigative approach, Secondary Two students participated in an interdisciplinary project exploring the inquiry question: “How do human activities affect the environmental sustainability of Tampines Eco-Green?” For the first time, students integrated knowledge from both Geography and Science to deepen their understanding of ecosystems and tropical forests. Guided by their teachers, they developed essential skills in data collection, analysis, and fieldwork techniques before applying them in the field. Despite the challenges of the afternoon heat, students enthusiastically conducted investigations, documented their observations through sketches, and proposed strategies for improving environmental sustainability. These projects exemplified Dunman Secondary School’s commitment to hands-on learning, fostering critical thinking and collaboration while strengthening students’ connection to their environment.</p>

**2\. Historical Investigation**
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ignite students’ curiosity about history and equip them with a critical historical perspective, we have designed Historical Investigation (HI) to bring classroom learning to life. Through learning journeys to the National Museum of Singapore, students engage with historical sources and apply key historical concepts in a meaningful way.</p>

**Sensory Skills Programme**
<p style="text-align: justify;">TThe members of the Sensory Skills Programme have increased in strength to 40 since its inception in 2019. The lower secondary students continue to actively monitor the environment along the 2 transects around Dunman Secondary School in conjunction with the NSS-ESN Programme. They have observed 25 different bird species such as the Green Imperial Pigeon and Long-tailed Shrike. The secondary two students continue to nature journal their observations and are also doing research on other bird species found in different environments other than Dunman Secondary School.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two main achievements so far by the students in the programme.  Firstly, two teams from the secondary 1 and 2 level achieved the top two positions of the ‘Highest Biodiversity Observed’ during the 2nd Biodiversity Race on 30th May 2023. The two teams raced with thirty other groups from other schools and managed to identify more than 30 different species of amphibians, birds, butterflies, and reptiles.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, the secondary 3 students updated their online game called ‘Avian Watch’ with local mascots like the pangolin, oriental pied hornbill and smooth coated otters that the students created themselves. They were invited by My First Skool @ Segar Road to share the game with the pre-schoolers and their parents during their Bird Race on the 8th of July 2023. They have been invited by Nature Society Singapore to share their partnership with My First Skool on the 2nd NSS-ESN Symposium in November.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The students will continue to work on their nature journals and inspire their peers within and beyond school to learn more about the biodiversity of their urban environment. Hopefully they will become environmental advocates of the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an example of a reflection done by Hong Dehui from 1B on the NSS-ESN Programme .</p>

**Comments by students :**

<p style="text-align: justify;">‘I felt that there is a variety of biodiversity in Singapore such as birds like Javan Myna, Spotted Doves, that could be noticed if we pay close attention to it. There are also some birds who we may not have noticed normally but they still are a part of the biodiversity which is also a part of learning such as their habitats and diet which allow me to understand the biodiversity of Singapore. My experience has been great from participating in the NSS-ESN programme so far and I thought it is beneficial as we could understand the bird species more and improve on our observational skills which helps us to identify the birds easier and faster.<br>
