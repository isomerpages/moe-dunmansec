### Mission / Objectives of Department
#### Our Vision
<p style="text-align: justify;">A discerning Dunmanite who appreciates the environment, keeps up-to-date with current issues, and possesses the ability to link the past, present and future.</p>

#### Our Mission
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Humanities Department is determined to provide students with a holistic and vigorous learning experience to help our students see the world through multiple lenses. We seek to equip our students with critical thinking and communication skills as well as encourage them to develop a global perspective so that they can become confident persons who are able to navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing world, active contributors and concerned citizens.</p>

### Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment (CPA)
#### History
<p style="text-align: justify;">The History Team in Dunman Secondary school seeks to develop a student who is a self-directed, active and concerned citizen. Our goal is for our students to be informed, discerning in judgement, asks questions and reflects on their process of learning. At the heart of history education lies the quest to uncover the complexities that define the human experience. This is especially valuable in a world where attention is often divided between concerns over the present and the future. Learning to manage the present and anticipate the future would not be possible without looking back at the past. Learning history helps students draw connections between the nature and impact of past developments, and how they affect the present world we live in.</p>

#### Geography
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the adoption of an issues-based approach that focuses on contemporary geographical issues, the syllabus provides students with an opportunity to explore geographical questions. The Geography Team at Dunman Secondary School utilizes the pedagogy of inquiry to expose students to geographical data from a variety of sources. They learn how to do so in a responsible and critical manner, which also helps them develop communication, collaboration and information skills effectively. This way, students gain a global awareness of current geographical issues and challenges, and develop a concern and appreciation for the environment around them.</p>

#### Social Studies
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Social Studies Team at Dunman Secondary School seeks to prepare students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the bigger world they live in, and appreciate complexities of the human experience. We try our best to create authentic learning experiences for our students through a range of different pedagogies that pique their interest in important societal issues. We hope that our students become informed, concerned and participative citizens that care about contributing responsibly to the society and world they live in.</p>

### Programmes and Activities
#### Inquiry-Based Learning

**1\. Geographical Investigation**
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunman’s Geographical Investigation (GI) provides students with the opportunities to appreciate real-world application of geographical knowledge and help them acquire 21st Century Competencies. From Secondary 1 to Secondary 3, Geography students carry out inquiry-based learning on various issues.</p>

**2\. Historical Investigation**
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our quest to pique students’ historical curiosity and provide them with a critical historical lens, we have designed Historical Investigation (HI) that makes real what has been learnt in the classroom. Some examples of HI sites include the Fort Canning Battle Box, former Ford factory, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Malay Heritage Centre and Indian Heritage Centre where students interact with sources and apply Historical concepts.</p>

**Sensory Skills Programme**
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Geography Unit from the Humanities Department introduced an initiative named the ‘<b>Sensory Skills Programme (SSP)</b>’ in 2019. It is linked to the <b>NSS</b> (Nature Society Singapore)-<b>ESN</b> (Every Singaporean A Naturalist) Biodiversity programme where lower secondary students were encouraged to monitor the urban biodiversity, particularly the bird biodiversity, in and around the school. The data they collected were uploaded on an online citizenry platform called iNaturalist for scientists and naturalist around the world to use for data interpretation of the biodiversity of the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To deepen the students’ observational and reflective skills especially during the Circuit Breaker period, the students were introduced to a mindful activity called **Nature Journaling** in 2020. In 2022, to further create greater awareness of the biodiversity of Dunman Secondary School environment, a few praiseworthy nature journals were selected and published into postcards as part of the school’s outreach efforts to primary schools.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To create greater interest in the biodiversity of Singapore, the students in the programme have been exposed to a number of external competitions and activities organised by Nature Society Singapore. Our students made the school proud by emerging champions in the **‘35th Bird Race for the Secondary School Category**’ in 2019 and the ‘**Inaugural Biodiversity Race in 2022’**. In addition, a few of the student’s nature journals were used as decorations in the ‘**Tree of the World 2021**’ fund raising project at Singapore Botanic Gardens.  This is in support of Singapore’s ‘One Million Tree Movement’.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, the Sec 2 students have also been invited to share their nature journaling experiences in this year’s **Inaugural NSS-ESN Symposium** to be held on the 4th of November 2022. To engage and stimulate interest in the biodiversity of Dunman Secondary School, the students have also created a game called ‘**Avian Watch**’ using the online gamification tool called ‘Genially’. This game will be used in the future as an outreach activity with external organisations especially primary schools and kindergartens.</p>

**Comments by students :**

>Honestly speaking, this programme was one of the best things about Secondary school. I have benefited in many ways from this programme such as understanding bird sounds and identifying the birds from their unique features, by learning the parts of a bird. Nature journaling has helped me learn how to proportionally draw birds and understand their diet and habitats of the bird. I have gained new knowledge from the research I have done on the different birds.<br>Before I joined the programme, birds used to be present around me but just unobserved. Since the programme, every single bird and animal started to catch my eye and gradually sparked my interest for me to go to parks around Singapore and even overseas to take a look at the variety of species present. All it takes is to notice the great flora and fauna around us.<br>\-Sanjana , 2F<br>

>I signed up to be part of this programme because I felt it would deepen my knowledge on birds and nature in general. It would also be an opportunity to improve my presentation skills. I can create a greater awareness of the biodiversity of the environment via social media, that way many people will be able to access what I share. Additionally, taking part in more opportunities like this would be able to provide me a platform to spread greater awareness about the biodiversity of the environment.<br>\- Natalie Ng, 2F
