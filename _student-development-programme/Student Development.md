3.  Delivering **structured Character & Citizenship Education Programme** that teach and provide opportunities for application of values and skills necessary for demonstrating positive behaviours.
4.  Providing **intervention support** for specific groups of students who require help in managing their behaviours and address unmet developmental and intrapersonal needs.
5.  Providing **capacity building opportunities for teachers** to enable them to carry out their disciplinary role effectively.
