# Cyber Wellness

**Members**

The CCE Cyber Wellness Department currently consists of a team of 4 cyber-wellness student ambassadors. These students are pioneers in the planning and execution of cyber-wellness related activities in Dunman Secondary School, starting from this year (2017). We hope to expand our team in the subsequent years.
