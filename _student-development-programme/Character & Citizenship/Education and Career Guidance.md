# Education and Career Guidance

### Introduction

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work. At secondary schools, the focus is on exploration; to help students understand themselves better in their skills, interests and abilities and guide their exploration of different education and career pathways. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st century.

### ECG Counselling

We have an ECG Counsellor to provide support to students (individually or in small groups). Students who would like to explore more in areas such as subject choices, course options or to find out more about their strengths and interests can have a chat with our school’s ECG Counsellor.
