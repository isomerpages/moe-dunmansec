<h4>Empowering Future-Ready Learners through Real-World AI Applications</h4>
<p>From 16 to 28 June 2025, Dunman Secondary School is proud to serve as
the official school partner for the inaugural Google AI Accelerator 2025
– a hands-on AI learning experience for students organised by SG Code Campus,
in partnership with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Google
Cloud, and the Cancer Science Institute (CSI) at the National University
of Singapore (NUS).</p>
<p>This two-week programme brings together selected students from secondary
schools and junior colleges across Singapore for an immersive, hands-on
learning experience in Python programming, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Machine Vision.</p>

<h4>Bridging Classroom Learning with Real-World Impact</h4>
<p>During the first week, students are engaged in 48 hours of instructor-led
training in Python and AI, using real-world tools such as Google Colab
and Vertex AI. In the following week, participants will work in project
teams to tackle a real-world biomedical challenge using anonymised cancer
imaging data provided by CSI, applying machine learning to develop meaningful,
real-life solutions.</p>
<p>The programme will culminate in a final project showcase at Google HQ
Singapore, where students will present their work to professionals in the
tech and healthcare sectors – a rare opportunity to experience authentic,
high-impact learning.</p>
