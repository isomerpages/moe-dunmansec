Dunman Secondary, together with Temasek Polytechnic have carefully curated Youth Digital Currency Programme (YDCP) to prepare your child/ward for the Technology of the future.

If your child’s/ward’s interest is leaning towards Informatics technology, this is the programme for your child/ward.

Topics Includes:
*   AI & Data Analytics
*   Web Development  
*   Computational Thinking
    

This programme will run from April 2023 to Feb 2024 and will require **100%** participation from your child/ward **if selected**. We hope that this programme will give your child/ward an early exposure to a polytechnic education and what the related sector entails. At the end of the programme, students will be assess based on the project they will have to produce.

Therefore, do consider carefully and discuss with your child if he/she would like to sign up for this programme.

The slides presented at the ZOOM engagement session on 10 March 2023 can be downloaded [here](/files/Announcements/YDCPMar2023.pdf).
