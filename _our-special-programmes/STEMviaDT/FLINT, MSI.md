### FLINT

**Mission/ Objectives**

In 2019, 6 teachers and 27 students from Dunman Secondary School visited Chiangmai, Thailand as part of their overseas FLINT (Fostering Life-Long Learning And Innovation In Normal Technical) trip. The goals for the trip are to provide opportunities for NT students to work together and develop life skills through exposure to a different culture, integration of content subjects (EBS, D&T, English) and learning service.

**Programmes and Activities**

The five days of activities were filled with numerous opportunities for the students to develop their cultural literacy and global awareness. Not only did the students “climbed” the tallest mountain in Thailand to explore and appreciate the beauty of the countryside.

They also visited the low farmlands to better understand how through the wisdom, generosity and far-sightedness of their late King Bhumibol and his numerous Royal’s projects initiatives, the citizens benefitted and stayed away from the ills of society like drugs.

This particular trip was very special as the students visited a rural primary school as well as orphanage where they brought good cheers and joy through their games and songs. The students also share the numerous gifts and donations they got from the school, family and friends.

Here are some of their reflections:

**Special thanks to all for making this trip possible – the parents, teachers, partners and most of all the active and spontaneous participation of the students!**

**Objectives**

We aim to provide a holistic education for our Normal (Academic) students. This is achieved through a differentiated N(A) curriculum in both the academic and non-academic aspects.

Differentiation in Instructional Programme is provided though subject banding in Science, English, Mathematics and Humanities. In addition, outstanding N(A) students are offered to take selected subjects (e.g., Literature, Design and Technology, Mother Tongue and Elementary Mathematics) at O level.

The Co-curricular Programme caters to the needs of the students through various customised programmes such as Learning Journeys, and Value In Action (VIA) activities. Learning Journeys to various post-secondary institutions were conducted for the Sec One to Five students to prepare them for their post-secondary education in the changing educational landscape. In September, the Sec One students went for the Health and Life-skill Outreach (HALO) exhibition at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, School of Health Sciences as part of their Learning Journey. Students learnt about healthcare through fun and interactive games on topics such as diabetes, wound dressing and fractures in hospital-themed rooms. In addition, the students had a hands-on lesson on how to prepare an arm sling.

Each level of N(A) students were engaged in different VIA activities with a specific theme for each level. For example, the Secondary 1 students were involved in VIA activities that made them more aware of the importance of environmental care. This year, all the Secondary Four students had the opportunity to participate in a 3-days 2-nights overseas VIA trip to Kluang from 3 to 5 January 2019. The main focus of the trip is to provide pupils with the opportunity to take on meaningful community service work as an active global citizen and also the opportunity to develop socio-cultural sensitivity and awareness through interactions with the locals.

Through the guidance of the teachers, the students from Secondary 4 Equality and 4 Inspiration embarked on various projects to serve the needs of the Kluang Community. The preparation work for the different VIA activities began in 2018. The students had an enriching time through the interactions with the primary school students from SK Taman University 3 and the children at Rumah Amal Raudhatul Maryam. The student also stayed at the UK Farm Agro Resort where they learnt more about the Kluang Modern Agriculture Project. The trip ended on a high with a campfire of songs and dance. Through the VIA projects and the trip, the students learnt about the importance of responsibility and teamwork. The whole process also strengthened the bond among the students from the two classes.
