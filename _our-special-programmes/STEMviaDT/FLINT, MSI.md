### FLINT

**Mission/ Objectives**

In 2019, 6 teachers and 27 students from Dunman Secondary School visited Chiangmai, Thailand as part of their overseas FLINT (Fostering Life-Long Learning And Innovation In Normal Technical) trip. The goals for the trip are to provide opportunities for NT students to work together and develop life skills through exposure to a different culture, integration of content subjects (EBS, D&T, English) and learning service.

**Programmes and Activities**

The five days of activities were filled with numerous opportunities for the students to develop their cultural literacy and global awareness. Not only did the students “climbed” the tallest mountain in Thailand to explore and appreciate the beauty of the countryside.
