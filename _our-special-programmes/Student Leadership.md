**Student Leadership Development (SLD) in Dunman Secondary School**

### STUDENT LEADERSHIP

Dunman Secondary School’s Student Leadership Development (SLD) programme is founded on the belief that the secondary school years are invaluable to developing character and inculcating the school’s values of Discernment, Discipline, Daring, Determination and Duty in our students.    
In line with the school’s vision of **Empathetic Leaders, Impactful Innovators**, Student Leadership Development provides a purposeful platform for our student leaders to explore complex issues related to the school and the Tampines community, and ideate for meaningful solutions.

**Dunman’s Student Leadership Framework – S.T.E.E.R**

Dunman’s student leadership framework is guided by the cyclical process of S -Selection, T-Training, E-empowerment, E-Evaluation and R-Recognition (STEER). The framework helps the Student Leadership Development Committee to bear in mind key pillars that ensures the intentional development of our student leaders.

**Heritage and Tradition**

Dunman Student Leaders continue to display a strong sense of belonging to the school and are appreciative of the opportunities provided for them. As such, our programmes are strengthened by alumni who return to the school to offer their mentorship and experience through various programmes – most notably through our alumni-led Leadership Training Camp.
