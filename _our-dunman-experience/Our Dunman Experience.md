<p>It is indeed heartening to see our Dunmanites leave our hands with the
Dunman creed deeply ingrained and
<br>Han Wee Kwang, our Dunman Alumni, has exemplified the Dunman values through
and through in his service to the nation. He was awarded the prestigious
title of National Serviceman (Full Time) of the year for 2022!</p>

<br>
<br>It is indeed heartening to see our students continue to apply the school
values in their areas of passion. Yim Zi Le Arthur, our Dunman Alumni of
cohort 2022, has exemplified the Dunman values of Discipline, Determination
and Daring as he completed Project Heartcode, a week-long intensive coding
and website building workshop conducted jointly by SMU School of Information
Systems and the CDAC. For his efforts, he was selected as valedictorian
to represent the student participants and share his experiences with sponsors,
SMU undergraduate mentors and CDAC staff.
<br>
<br>Arthur, continue to learn and keep the torch burning!</p>
