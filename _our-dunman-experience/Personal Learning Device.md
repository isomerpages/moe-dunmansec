<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Transforming Learners Through Technology.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Future-Ready Ethical Digital Learners.</p>
<h3>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive&nbsp;by&nbsp;equipping students with the digital literacies&nbsp;to be future-ready.
	
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The NDLP aims to equip our students with Digital Literacies. Digital Literacies better enable our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find,&nbsp;Think,&nbsp;Apply&nbsp;and&nbsp;Create’ framework.</p>

<h3>Device Management Application (DMA)</h3>

a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and with school hours from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The school determines the applications (apps) to be installed in our students' PLD to support teaching and learning.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">All PLDs are pre-installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) to provide a safer digital environment for learning and safeguard our students' cyber wellness.

Parents/Guardians may inform the school by filling up an online form <a href="https://go.gov.sg/dmndmachange" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p></p>
