<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Transforming Learners Through Technology.</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Future-Ready Ethical Digital Learners.</p>
<h3>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive&nbsp;by&nbsp;equipping students with the digital literacies&nbsp;to be future-ready.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The NDLP aims to equip our students with Digital Literacies.&nbsp;Digital
Literacies better enable our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find,&nbsp;Think,&nbsp;Apply&nbsp;and&nbsp;Create’
framework.</p>

a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and school hours is from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.&nbsp;The school determines the applications (apps) and programmes to be installed
