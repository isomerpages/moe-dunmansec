# Sport and Recreation Club
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sport and Recreation Club was set up to encourage student's participation in physical recreational activities. To date we have offered more than 30 different sports and the list is growing. Some of the more popular activities include ice skating, mountain biking, fencing, dragon boating, kayaking, scuba diving, sailing, bowling, handball, golf and archery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through these activities, students will get the opportunity to inculcate values like discipline, determination and discernment while at the same time spark their interest to purse a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>
