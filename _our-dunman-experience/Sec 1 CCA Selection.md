<p style="text-align: justify;">At Dunman Secondary School, our studentsâ€™ Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) programmes are diverse and engaging. Dunmanites are keen learners in pursuit of their passions and interests, which the school supports wholeheartedly and thoroughly.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunmanites are truly enthusiastic about their many interests, whether in <b>Uniformed Groups, Sports &amp; Games</b>, <b>Performing Arts</b>, or <b>Clubs</b>. Whichever CCA they join, nurturing a sense of commitment and dedication to their craft is part of the culture here. We aim to engage them in a CCA where they can grow, develop, and excel.
Below are all the CCAs offered in Dunman Secondary School:.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All Dunmanites are required to join a core CCA offered by the school.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the start of Secondary One, the school organizes performing arts auditions and sports trials to identify students' strengths. During the CCA Fair, students can explore various CCAs, providing them with information to help them choose a CCA that suits their interests and abilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each Secondary 1 student will be assigned a CCA based on their top five choices. Students are expected to stay in their selected CCA throughout their secondary school years unless they have valid medical reasons preventing them from fulfilling their commitments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Students are advised to make their choices carefully, as they may not always get their first choice if the CCA is oversubscribed. In such cases, they may be assigned one of their other selected choices.</p>
