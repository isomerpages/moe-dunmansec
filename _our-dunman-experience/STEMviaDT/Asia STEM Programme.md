# Asia STEM Programme

<p style="text-align: justify;">The comprehensively designed Asia STEM Programme offers students in our school an opportunity to extend their educational experience beyond Singapore so as to empower them to be empathetic leaders and impactful innovators for tomorrow.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through our growing network of partnerships that include schools in Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Thailand, students grow in their awareness of global issues, learn to solve problems to deliver social impact, and collaborate with others in a culturally diverse and fast-changing environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Asia STEM Programme is carefully scaffolded to offer a varied exposure for students to the necessary global competency skills through an engaging and interactive experience in another country or collaborating via an IT-enabled platform.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that these experiences will not only provide our students with the authentic contexts to support in their development of relevant 21 century competencies but also nurtures them to be more self-directed and inquisitive so as to better equipped them to be ethical change makers of the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2021, undeterred by the pandemic, our Sec 3 students dived deep to engage peers from China and Cambodia to discuss issues relating to Sustainability, Community and Technology and itâ€™s impact on Humanity.</p>
