### Student Development &amp; Management Approaches

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school adopts a whole-school, multi-pronged approach to student development and management&nbsp;through the following key strategies: </p>

1. **Whole School Approach**&nbsp;through involving all staff and students in establishing supportive&nbsp;policies, systems and practices.
2. Building a&nbsp;**culture of care**&nbsp;through establishing positive school and school classroom&nbsp;environments in which students feel safe and cared for and have a sense of belonging to the&nbsp;school.  
3. Delivering&nbsp;**structured Character &amp; Citizenship Education Programme**&nbsp;that teach and provide&nbsp;opportunities for application of values and skills necessary for demonstrating positive behaviours.  
4. Providing&nbsp;**intervention support**&nbsp;for specific groups of students who require help in managing&nbsp;their behaviours and address unmet developmental and intrapersonal needs.    
5. Providing&nbsp;**capacity building opportunities for teachers**&nbsp;to enable them to carry out their&nbsp;disciplinary role effectively.
