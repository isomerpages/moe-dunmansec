### Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Dunman Table Tennis, we give students the opportunity to explore their interest in table tennis and even to pick up a new sport. We participated annually in the East Zone Table Tennis Championship and our players put in their best effort to pit skills against other school players. Players also get additional exposure by taking part in friendly matches. Besides becoming a competent and confident player through trainings and games, we also aim to provide leadership opportunities for our students in order to nature them into responsible individuals. For instances, they will spearhead major events like Table Tennis Camp, Open House, CCA orientation and so on.</p>
