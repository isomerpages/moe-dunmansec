Together you and I will leave  
As distinctive Dunmanites,  
Discerning in our choice of right from what is not,  
Disciplined in attitude and conduct;  
Daring to experiment and forge breakthroughs and;  
Determined in all that we do;  
As it is our Duty  
To serve and better our school, community and nation.

Every child has different abilities, can become an enquiring and independent learner, and can learn to accept responsibility for his learning outcome.
