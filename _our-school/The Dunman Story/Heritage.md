### **The Haig Road Years**
### **In the Beginning: Planting a Strong Foundation**

> _“We have every intention of making our school the prestigious school for Katong first, and finally the prestigious school for the whole of Singapore... this is no pipe dream. It is an attainable goal. It may take time, but I am serious - we shall overcome”._


#### Establishing Dunman Integrated Secondary School

<p style="text-align: justify;">Against the backdrop of the Communists infiltrating Chinese schools for political gains in the 1950s, an All-Party Committee on Chinese Education in Singapore was appointed. The Committee presented a report that addressed the challenges of fostering social cohesion among students in Singapore and emphasized the importance of bilingual education as well as the, inter-mingling of students from different language-medium schools. As a result, the government set up schools where two or more language streams were housed under one administration and one principal. Called Integrated Schools, these establishments brought students of various ethnicities into close proximity, creating an environment and opportunity for fostering racial harmony. The pioneering spirit of Dunman and the boldness to break new ground were encoded in its very being when it was founded. Dunman Secondary School, founded in 1963, was the first of its kind, as it was one of the first Integrated Schools in Singapore, and it was the first with triple integration. This foreshadowed subsequent attempts for schools to become the common space for forging a common identity, regardless of race, language or religion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunman Integrated Secondary School was situated at Haig Road and shared a large field with other schools. It was named after Sir Thomas Dunman, the first Commissioner of Police in Singapore from 1856 to 1871. Mr Ng Yeow Chong, then the Assemblyman for Mountbatten, officially opened the school premises on 16 October 1963. Dunman’s first  Principal was Mr Au Keng Chu. As the school pioneer, he created both the school badge and the school motto: ‘Knowledge is the Torch of Life’.</p>

#### Setting the Cornerstones

<p style="text-align: justify;">The early years of Dunman were about planting a strong foundation. Excellence, innovation and ethics, the cornerstones of the school, were set right from the beginning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While Dunman had very humble roots, in fact, sharing premises with well-known schools, it was bold to claim the vision of rising above its circumstances to be an established school that was well-regarded and well-sought after for its education. Dunman’s first intake of students was enrolled in the school even as the building was under construction. The nine English-stream secondary one classes were held at Mattar West Vocational Institute and three Malay-stream secondary one classes were held at Tun Seri Lanang School before they moved into the new school which was completed in August 1963. Dunman’s enrolment increased dramatically with 22 English stream classes and 21 Malay stream classes, just one year after its opening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1964, Dunman became the first integrated school with three mediums of instruction after 10 classes of Chinese-stream students were integrated into the school. The results of integration were tested during the 1964 race riots in Singapore. On 21 July 1964, a race riot broke out in Singapore but the school was spared problems because classes were not in session. However, six weeks later, fresh riots broke out in the Joo Chiat area. This unrest took place two kilometres from the school.</p>

> _“On 3 September, we had wind of communal unrest occurring in the Joo Chiat area between Chinese and Malay gangs, and as soon as parents phoned in to inquire about their children’s safety, I decided to close the school. I ordered the gates to be manned by teachers and the watchman...”_  – Mr Au Keng Chu, first Principal of Dunman Integrated Secondary School.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Parents began to appear at the school gates. For students whose parents did not come to get them, Mr. Au organised the teachers and staff to ferry them home. When the news of the riots broke, all of the canteen operators fled. Thus during the ordeal, no food or drinks were available for the staff and students. However, neighbours of all races brought biscuits, drinks and other foods. Mr Au recalled, “When school re-opened, the pupils returned to school surprisingly unaffected by the scary reports of the past few days of fights in their locality. I believe that the conduct of the teachers of the different language streams working solidly together to see to the safety and the welfare of the pupils regardless of their race could have impressed them and their parents that all could be well if we could put aside our differences. The conduct of my staff was exemplary”.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In August 1965, the Malay-stream staff and students were transferred to Telok Kurau Secondary School. Dunman then functioned as an English-Chinese Integrated School. In 1968, Mr John De Souza, a music teacher of the school composed Dunman’s school song. It expresses the school’s purpose and mission.In the same year, Mr Tiong Dak Yu became the second Principal. The school’s first Advisory Committee was officially formed with Mr Tan Tock San as the Chairman.</p>
