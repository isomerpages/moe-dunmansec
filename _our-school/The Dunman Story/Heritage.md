### **The Haig Road Years**
### **In the Beginning: Planting a Strong Foundation**

> _“We have every intention of making our school the prestigious school for Katong first, and finally the prestigious school for the whole of Singapore... this is no pipe dream. It is an attainable goal. It may take time, but I am serious - we shall overcome”._


#### Establishing Dunman Integrated Secondary School

<p style="text-align: justify;">Against the backdrop of the Communists infiltrating Chinese schools for political gains in the 1950s, an All-Party Committee on Chinese Education in Singapore was appointed. The Committee presented a report that addressed the challenges of fostering social cohesion among students in Singapore and emphasized the importance of bilingual education as well as the, inter-mingling of students from different language-medium schools. As a result, the government set up schools where two or more language streams were housed under one administration and one principal. Called Integrated Schools, these establishments brought students of various ethnicities into close proximity, creating an environment and opportunity for fostering racial harmony. The pioneering spirit of Dunman and the boldness to break new ground were encoded in its very being when it was founded. Dunman Secondary School, founded in 1963, was the first of its kind, as it was one of the first Integrated Schools in Singapore, and it was the first with triple integration. This foreshadowed subsequent attempts for schools to become the common space for forging a common identity, regardless of race, language or religion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dunman Integrated Secondary School was situated at Haig Road and shared a large field with other schools. It was named after Sir Thomas Dunman, the first Commissioner of Police in Singapore from 1856 to 1871. Mr Ng Yeow Chong, then the Assemblyman for Mountbatten, officially opened the school premises on 16 October 1963. Dunman’s first  Principal was Mr Au Keng Chu. As the school pioneer, he created both the school badge and the school motto: ‘Knowledge is the Torch of Life’.</p>

#### Setting the Cornerstones

<p style="text-align: justify;">The early years of Dunman were about planting a strong foundation. Excellence, innovation and ethics, the cornerstones of the school, were set right from the beginning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While Dunman had very humble roots, in fact, sharing premises with well-known schools, it was bold to claim the vision of rising above its circumstances to be an established school that was well-regarded and well-sought after for its education. Dunman’s first intake of students was enrolled in the school even as the building was under construction. The nine English-stream secondary one classes were held at Mattar West Vocational Institute and three Malay-stream secondary one classes were held at Tun Seri Lanang School before they moved into the new school which was completed in August 1963. Dunman’s enrolment increased dramatically with 22 English stream classes and 21 Malay stream classes, just one year after its opening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1964, Dunman became the first integrated school with three mediums of instruction after 10 classes of Chinese-stream students were integrated into the school. The results of integration were tested during the 1964 race riots in Singapore. On 21 July 1964, a race riot broke out in Singapore but the school was spared problems because classes were not in session. However, six weeks later, fresh riots broke out in the Joo Chiat area. This unrest took place two kilometres from the school.</p>

> _“On 3 September, we had wind of communal unrest occurring in the Joo Chiat area between Chinese and Malay gangs, and as soon as parents phoned in to inquire about their children’s safety, I decided to close the school. I ordered the gates to be manned by teachers and the watchman...”_  – Mr Au Keng Chu, first Principal of Dunman Integrated Secondary School.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Parents began to appear at the school gates. For students whose parents did not come to get them, Mr. Au organised the teachers and staff to ferry them home. When the news of the riots broke, all of the canteen operators fled. Thus during the ordeal, no food or drinks were available for the staff and students. However, neighbours of all races brought biscuits, drinks and other foods. Mr Au recalled, “When school re-opened, the pupils returned to school surprisingly unaffected by the scary reports of the past few days of fights in their locality. I believe that the conduct of the teachers of the different language streams working solidly together to see to the safety and the welfare of the pupils regardless of their race could have impressed them and their parents that all could be well if we could put aside our differences. The conduct of my staff was exemplary”.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In August 1965, the Malay-stream staff and students were transferred to Telok Kurau Secondary School. Dunman then functioned as an English-Chinese Integrated School. In 1968, Mr John De Souza, a music teacher of the school composed Dunman’s school song. It expresses the school’s purpose and mission.In the same year, Mr Tiong Dak Yu became the second Principal. The school’s first Advisory Committee was officially formed with Mr Tan Tock San as the Chairman.</p>

#### Building an Identity

One of the most memorable events in the history of the school took place in 1970 when the Dunmanites put up a display, ‘Fountain of Youth’ at the Padang during the National Day Parade. Dunman was the only school to perform that year and the display was the finale for the parade. Every single Dunman girl and 336 boys took part in the performance. The event contributed to the bonding of all Dunmanites. The results for the GCE ‘O’ level that year was the best ever.

In 1971, Mr Chiu Hock Seng became Dunman’s third Principal.

As Dunman developed building a distinctive identity and instilling a strong sense of belonging among the students in the school became increasingly necessary. Thus, in 1975, the Dunman statue of the boy and girl students we know and love so well was completed at a cost of $1500 by Mr Lim Nang Seng, who was also the sculptor of the Merlion. Today, the statue stands proudly in front of the school porch, as a symbol of Dunman. In 1976, Mr Poon Meng Seng became the fourth Principal of Dunman. The school saw its first female Principal when Mrs Jeanette Ho was appointed to lead the school in 1981. 

In 1985, Mr Johnny Lau became the sixth Principal.

The school’s development in its earlier years was not without its challenges. This included the need for greater organizational efficiency, and student-related issues. The school also suffered from falling enrolment. Juxtaposed against the larger educational landscape, the Singapore education system had embarked on an efficiency-driven phase where the focus was on reducing the attrition rate and wastage in the system.

#### Trailblazing in the 1980s

In the 1980s, the school leaders and staff took on these challenges with a bold and determined spirit. Many important school-based initiatives were introduced to ensure a healthy organizational culture. Once again as a pioneer, Dunman was the first school to institute the now familiar Heads-of-Department scheme to better serve the needs of staff and students. The Former Dunmanites Association (FDA), an idea mooted during the school’s 20th anniversary dinner celebrations in 1983, was inaugurated in October 1985. In addition, an increasing awareness of the need to nurture students holistically, and in leadership development existed. The school wanted to look into the socio-emotional needs of the students and to give them a voice. The formation of the Student Welfare Unit and Class Committees in 1985 provided numerous opportunities for students to lead and organise themselves. Dunman was also the first school to launch the Pastoral Care programme to look into a student’s development holistically. The main aim of the Pastoral Care programme was to enable every student to have at least one teacher as a mentor to care and develop his or her potential. This move affirmed the importance of building positive teacher-student relationship which remains a cornerstone of the school till today.

In January 1987, Dunman took in Pre-University One students. That same year, the first Students’ Council was elected and the Pre-University One students became the pioneer batch of Student Councillors. The Pre-University classes came to an end in 1991. During this time, the school also focused on building ties with the parents to encourage their involvement in their children’s education. The first Meet-the-Parents session was held on 31 May 1985 and became a regular feature of the school. TheDunman Focus, a quarterly newsletter, was also published. The aim of theDunmanFocuswas to foster closer ties among the school, students and parents. 1988 was a significant year as the school turned 25 years. Around this time, discussions about finding a new home for Dunman took place. The premises at Haig Road was more than 20 years old. It could not be extended and lacked the modern facilities found in newer schools. The school leadership was offered several possible locations for Dunman, and ultimately, decided that Tampines would be an ideal location given that it was situated in a new town.

Mrs Tay Sor Har who became the seventh Principal of Dunman, carried out the school’s movement to its new premises.
