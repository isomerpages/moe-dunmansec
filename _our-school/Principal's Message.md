<p style="text-align: justify;"> Dunman Secondary School has distinguished itself as an outstanding choice school in the East for more than half a century, bearing the hallmarks of excellence, innovation and ethics. It has inspired and transformed generations of Dunmanites into responsible citizens, equipped with future ready competencies, to actualise their aspirations while serving the community and nation with sound values and compassion. </p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Our unique Dunman Total Curriculum prepares our Dunmanites for their future workplace and is fully aligned with our government’s Smart Nation initiative and Green Plan 2030 initiative. Besides laying a strong academic foundation for our Dunmanites in the area of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines, we exposed our students to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet Of Things (IOT) and coding. We will continue to nurture Dunmanites into resilient ethical change-makers through our community outreach Values-in-Action programme using Design Thinking. Our adoption of iPad as the Personal Learning Device for our Dunmanites will further reinforce our efforts in developing them into tech-enabled self-directed and collaborative learners.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the East Zone Centre Of Excellence (EZ COE) for Innovations in Science, we will continue to collaborate with A Star, Singapore Science Centre, National Institute of Education and tertiary institutes to bring high quality and engaging Science Enrichment activities to students from schools in the East and ignite their passion for Science. We will also provide STEM related workshops and courses for teachers. With the support of these STEM-trained teachers, we hope to develop a pipeline of STEM talents for Singapore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To identify and develop even more STEM talents, we will be expanding our DSA to include STEM in 2023. We will be reaching out to primary schools in the East from 2021 to 2022 to offer STEM masterclasses and enrichment camps for selected Primary 4 and Primary 5 students. We would also encourage Primary 6 students who have strong passion for Science and Mathematics to join us at our <b><i>e-Open House on</i></b> <b><i><u>13 November</u></i></b> to find out more about our ‘upgraded’ <b><i>ELIXIR Plus Programme</i></b>.     </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides our strategic partners, all of our achievements would not have been possible without the strong support of our stakeholders – our School Advisory Committee, our Dedicated Supportive Parents, our Dunman Secondary Alumni and our Dunman Youth Alumni as well as our committed and dedicated teachers. I look forward to working with all of our stakeholders, strategic partners and teachers as one Dunman family to enable all Dunmanites to excel!</p>


Warmest Regards,
