# Sec 1 CCA Selection

At Dunman Secondary School, our students’ Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) programmes are full and varied. Dunmanites are keen learners in pursuit of their passion and interest, which the school supports whole-heartedly and thoroughly.

Dunmanites are truly keen on their many interests; be it Uniformed Groups, Sports & Games, Performing Arts, or Clubs. Whichever CCA they are in, nurturing a sense of commitment and dedication to their craft is the culture here, and we want to engage them in a CCA which they can develop and excel in.
