### Mission

Transforming Learners Through Technology.  

### Vision

Future-Ready Ethical Digital Learners.  

### National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)


The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.

The NDLP aims to equip our students with Digital Literacies. Digital Literacies better enable our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find, Think, Apply and Create’ framework.
